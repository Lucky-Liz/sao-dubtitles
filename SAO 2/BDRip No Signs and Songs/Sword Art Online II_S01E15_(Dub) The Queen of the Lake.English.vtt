00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:06.346
Host: ONLY THREE DAYS LEFT
TILL THE NEW YEAR,

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:09.057
AND I HOPE YOU'RE ALL
ENJOYING YOUR HOLIDAY.

00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:11.976
Suguha: HEY,
WERE YOU UP LATE AGAIN?

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:13.228
Kazuto: YEAH,

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.647
FOR A MECHATRONICS PROJECT
FOR SCHOOL.

00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:18.107
Suguha: MECHA‐WHAT? SOUNDS FUN.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:19.984
Host: ...FROM THE TRAFFIC
INFORMATION CENTER.

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:21.236
‐ Suguha: KAZUTO.
‐ Kazuto: HMM?

00:00:21.277 --> 00:00:22.528
Suguha: YOU SEE THIS YET?

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.030
‐ (CUP CLATTERS)
‐ Kazuto: WHAT THE?!

00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:27.408
THE HOLY SWORD EXCALIBUR
HAS BEEN FOUND IN A.L.O.?!

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.202
AW, MAN, THAT SUCKS.

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:32.205
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SOMEONE ELSE BEAT US TO IT.

00:00:32.247 --> 00:00:33.581
Suguha: READ THE ARTICLE, DOOFUS.

00:00:33.623 --> 00:00:35.375
IT SAYS IT'S BEEN FOUND, IS ALL.

00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:37.293
NO ONE'S ACTUALLY GOT IT YET.

00:00:38.294 --> 00:00:39.254
Kazuto: OH.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:40.255
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:41.881
DON'T SCARE ME LIKE THAT.

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:43.675
Suguha: (CHUCKLES)

00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:47.387
Kazuto: A COUPLE MONTHS AGO
ON THE ARUN PLAINS,

00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:50.556
LEAFA, YUI, AND ME GOT SWALLOWED
BY A BIG‐ASS MONSTER WORM.

00:00:50.598 --> 00:00:54.310
IT DROPPED US IN AN UNDERGROUND
REALM CALLED JOTUNHEIM.

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:55.895
WE LOOKED AROUND FOR A BIT

00:00:55.937 --> 00:00:58.606
AND CAME ACROSS THIS FOUR‐ARMED
HUMANOID MONSTER.

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:01.568
IT WAS FIGHTING ANOTHER MONSTER
THAT LOOKED LIKE A CROSS

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.486
BETWEEN AN ELEPHANT
AND A JELLYFISH.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:06.239
GO FIGURE. LEAFA FELT SORRY
FOR THE JELLY‐PHANT THING

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.199
AND TOLD ME TO GO SAVE IT.

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.410
I LURED FOUR ARMS
ONTO THIS FROZEN LAKE,

00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:12.412
AND IT FELL THROUGH THE ICE.

00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:14.330
THEN THE JELLY‐PHANT
TOOK CARE OF IT.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.709
LEAFA DECIDED TO CALL IT TONKY,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.335
AND SUDDENLY IT TRANSFORMED

00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:21.838
INTO AN EVEN‐WEIRDER‐LOOKING
THING WITH EIGHT WINGS.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:25.341
WE HOPPED ON ITS BACK,
AND IT TOOK US TO A PASSAGEWAY

00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:27.218
LEADING TO THE SURFACE WORLD.

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.058
ON THE WAY UP WAS WHEN WE
SAW IT, AN UPSIDE‐DOWN PYRAMID

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.728
HANGING FROM THE ROOTS
OF THE WORLD TREE

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:39.939
AND A LONG, GOLDEN SWORD
SHIMMERING INSIDE.

00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:48.239
EXCALIBUR.

00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:51.659
I WAS PLANNING ON GOING BACK
FOR IT SOMEDAY, BUT NOW...

00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:53.328
Suguha: IT'D BE A NICE BREAK

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.788
FROM ALL THAT FLOOR‐CLEARING
YOU'RE DOING IN NEW AINCRAD.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.790
Kazuto: THIS ARTICLE
DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING

00:01:57.832 --> 00:01:59.208
ABOUT HOW THEY FOUND IT.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.877
PLAYERS CAN'T FLY
IN JOTUNHEIM, REMEMBER?

00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:03.546
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SPOT EXCALIBUR.

00:02:03.588 --> 00:02:05.423
THAT THING'S TOO HIGH UP TO SEE.

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:07.759
Suguha: UNLESS THEY RESCUED
ONE OF TONKY'S FRIENDS,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.844
HITCHED A RIDE,
AND TRIGGERED THE QUEST FLAG.

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:12.055
IF WE COULD DO IT,
SO COULD SOMEONE ELSE.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:14.223
Kazuto: I GUESS
THAT MAKES SENSE,

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:15.892
ALTHOUGH WHO'D TRUST A CREEPY‐‐

00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:17.852
‐ Suguha: (GROWLS)
‐ Kazuto: (GRUNTS)

00:02:17.894 --> 00:02:20.855
UH, I MEAN WHO'D TRUST
SUCH A UNIQUE MONSTER

00:02:20.897 --> 00:02:23.066
‐ UNLESS THEY HAD WEIRD TA‐‐
‐ Suguha: (GROWLS)

00:02:23.107 --> 00:02:25.109
Kazuto: I MEAN
A WEIRDLY BIG HEART.

00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:26.110
(BUBBLES BUBBLING)

00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:27.654
SOMEONE JUST LIKE YOU, SIS.

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:28.696
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

00:02:28.738 --> 00:02:29.781
Suguha: HE IS NOT CREEPY.

00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:31.115
HE'S ADORABLE.

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:33.660
ANYWAY, THE WHOLE POINT
OF SHOWING YOU THAT

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:35.078
WAS TO GET YOU GOING.

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:37.413
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE SOMEONE

00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:39.666
GRINDS THROUGH THAT DUNGEON
AND GETS THE SWORD.

00:02:39.707 --> 00:02:41.250
Kazuto: YOU'RE RIGHT.
CLOCK'S TICKING.

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:44.003
Suguha: SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

00:02:45.963 --> 00:02:47.382
Kazuto: (CLEARS THROAT)

00:02:47.423 --> 00:02:50.426
SUGU, GETTING RARE ITEMS
ISN'T THE POINT OF IT.

00:02:50.468 --> 00:02:53.388
IF THAT'S ALL YOU PLAY FOR,
YOU'RE MISSING OUT.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.223
Suguha: YEAH,
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:57.809
THERE'S FUNNER THINGS TO DO
THAN BOOSTING STATS.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.976
Kazuto: I WASN'T FINISHED.

00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:01.145
I THINK TONKY
WANTED US TO FIND IT,

00:03:01.187 --> 00:03:03.106
AND THAT'S WHY
HE SHOWED US WHERE IT WAS.

00:03:03.147 --> 00:03:05.858
FOR SOME REASON, HE NEEDS US
TO CLEAR THAT DUNGEON,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.945
SO IT'S UP TO US
TO MAKE HIS WISH COME TRUE.

00:03:08.986 --> 00:03:10.571
TONKY'S OUR FRIEND,
AND THERE'S NO WAY

00:03:10.613 --> 00:03:12.198
I'M TURNING MY BACK ON A FRIEND.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.950
Suguha: MMM!

00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.577
A MINUTE AGO,
YOU CALLED YOUR FRIEND CREEPY.

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:18.496
Kazuto: MM.

00:03:18.538 --> 00:03:19.872
I MEANT CREEPY COOL.

00:03:19.914 --> 00:03:21.749
ANYWAY, YOU IN?

00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.502
Suguha: SURE. I DON'T HAVE
PRACTICE 'CAUSE OF THE HOLIDAYS.

00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:25.586
Kazuto: AWESOME.

00:03:25.628 --> 00:03:27.171
OKAY, WE'LL NEED SEVEN OTHERS.

00:03:27.213 --> 00:03:29.006
WE DON'T WANT TO OVERLOAD TONKY.

00:03:29.048 --> 00:03:31.676
FOR STARTERS, WE GOT
YOU, ME, AND ASUNA.

00:03:31.717 --> 00:03:34.345
THEN THERE'S KLEIN,
LIZ, AND SILICA.

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:36.722
WE NEED ONE MORE PERSON.

00:03:36.764 --> 00:03:39.308
AGIL'S GOTTA WORK TONIGHT.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.060
CHRYSHEIGHT'S
NOT LEVELED UP YET.

00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:43.479
RECON'S GRINDING
IN SYLPH TERRITORY.

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:44.772
Suguha: OH, I KNOW.

00:03:44.814 --> 00:03:46.691
LET'S ASK SINON TO COME ALONG.

00:03:46.732 --> 00:03:48.776
Kazuto: GREAT IDEA, SIS.

00:03:48.818 --> 00:03:50.069
Suguha: WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?

00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:51.737
I'LL MESSAGE 'EM RIGHT NOW,

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.407
EXCEPT FOR ASUNA.
I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU.

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:55.700
Kazuto: OKAY.

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:59.912
Asuna: (SIGHS)

00:03:59.954 --> 00:04:02.457
I WISH I COULD SEE KIRITO AGAIN

00:04:02.498 --> 00:04:04.917
BEFORE I GO VISIT
MY GRANDPARENTS.

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.378
(RINGTONE CHIMING)

00:04:09.797 --> 00:04:11.841
H‐HI, KIRITO.

00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:13.301
Kazuto: MORNING, ASUNA.

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:14.802
SORRY TO CALL SO EARLY.

00:04:14.844 --> 00:04:17.430
WE WERE PLANNING
ON GOING ON A QUEST

00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:19.849
IN A.L.O. THIS AFTERNOON.
YOU WANT TO GO?

00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:22.810
Asuna: YEAH, I'LL TOTALLY GO.
I'M FREE ALL DAY TODAY.

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:25.062
Kazuto: COOL. I'LL TEXT YOU
THE TIME AND PLACE,

00:04:25.104 --> 00:04:26.773
SO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR IT.

00:04:26.814 --> 00:04:28.357
Asuna: YOU KNOW I WILL.

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:30.651
SEE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE, THEN.

00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:32.779
YES.

00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:12.663
Klein: (SIGHS)

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.081
‐ (LAUGHS)
‐ Silica: HEY, KLEIN,

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:16.584
DO YOU GET TO TAKE VACATION
FOR NEW YEAR'S?

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.168
Klein: BEEN ON IT
SINCE YESTERDAY.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.504
EVEN IF I WANTED TO WORK‐‐
AND I DON'T‐‐

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.172
THERE'S NO SHIPMENTS
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:24.008
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY CHEAP‐ASS BOSS SAID?

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:26.302
"BE THANKFUL YOU GOT
A JOB WHERE YOU GET

00:06:26.343 --> 00:06:27.761
A WHOLE WEEK OFF
FOR NEW YEAR'S,"

00:06:27.803 --> 00:06:30.222
BRAGGING ABOUT IT LIKE HE
WAS DOING US A FAVOR.

00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:31.974
AND SPEAKING OF FAVORS,

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:34.393
IF WE DO MANAGE
TO SNAG EXCALIBUR TODAY,

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:36.228
HOW ABOUT DOING ME A SOLID

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.064
AND HELPING ME GET MY HANDS
ON THE SOUL BLADE KAGUZUCHI?

00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:40.441
Kirito: SERIOUSLY?

00:06:40.482 --> 00:06:42.359
THAT DUNGEON'S LIKE
A FRIGGING OVEN, MAN.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.653
Klein: YEAH, WELL,
I'M GOING TO JOTUNHEIM FOR YOU,

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:46.739
WHERE IT'S COLDER
THAN THE ASS‐END OF AN ICE POP.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.658
Sinon: YOU KNOW, I WANT
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS, TOO,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.951
THE SHEKHINAH BOW.

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:53.620
Kirito: UH, YOUR AVATAR'S
TWO WEEKS OLD,

00:06:53.662 --> 00:06:56.415
AND ALREADY YOU'RE GUNNING
FOR A LEGENDARY WEAPON?

00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:58.959
Sinon: YEAH, WELL, THAT BOW
LIZ MADE ME IS GREAT AND ALL,

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.878
BUT I NEED SOMETHING
WITH A LITTLE MORE RANGE.

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:02.421
Lisbeth: OH, YEAH?

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:05.632
THEN WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU
USING A BOW IN A.L.O. FOR?

00:07:05.674 --> 00:07:07.718
THEIR RANGE FALLS
BETWEEN SPEARS AND MAGIC.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.929
YOU'RE LIKE THE ONLY PLAYER
WHO WANTS TO USE THESE THINGS

00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:12.431
TO SNIPE FROM 100 METERS.

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:13.974
Sinon: IF I HAD MY WAY,

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:15.809
I'D WANT DOUBLE
THAT RANGE AT LEAST.

00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:17.353
Lisbeth: (GASPS)

00:07:17.394 --> 00:07:18.812
(CHUCKLES)

00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:21.148
Leafa: WE'RE BACK, GUYS.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.524
Asuna: THANKS FOR WAITING.

00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:24.777
Silica: WE THOUGHT
YOU WERE NEVER COMING BACK.

00:07:24.818 --> 00:07:27.029
Klein: WHAT'S UP?
YOU GET LOST OR SOMETHING?

00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:28.447
Yui: NOT AT ALL.

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.908
WE WERE GATHERING INFORMATION
WHILE WE SHOPPED.

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:33.702
WE TALKED TO A WHOLE BUNCH
OF PEOPLE, DADDY,

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:36.121
AND SO FAR,
NOT ONE PLAYER OR PARTY

00:07:36.163 --> 00:07:37.456
HAS REACHED THAT DUNGEON YET.

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:39.249
Kirito: REALLY?

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:42.044
WELL, THEN HOW THE HECK DO THEY
KNOW WHERE EXCALIBUR'S AT?

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:43.462
Yui: THAT'S THE THING, DADDY.

00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:45.589
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHERE IT IS.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.341
APPARENTLY THEY FOUND
A DIFFERENT QUEST

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:49.093
THAN THE ONE TONKY SHOWED US.

00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:52.304
THEY MET AN NPC WHO TOLD THEM IF
THEY FINISHED THIS OTHER QUEST,

00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:55.140
THEY'D GET EXCALIBUR
AS THE REWARD.

00:07:55.182 --> 00:07:57.142
Asuna: AND FROM WHAT WE HEARD,

00:07:57.184 --> 00:07:59.812
THE QUEST THEY'RE GOING ON
ISN'T VERY PLEASANT.

00:07:59.853 --> 00:08:03.399
INSTEAD OF A DELIVERY QUEST
OR AN ESCORT QUEST,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.194
IT'S A KILL QUEST,
JUST SLAUGHTERING MONSTERS.

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:09.655
EVERYONE IN JOTUNHEIM
IS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:11.490
KILLING AS MANY AS THEY CAN.

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:14.368
Kirito: YEAH, THAT DOESN'T EVEN
SOUND CLOSE TO BEING PLEASANT.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.037
Klein: THIS WHOLE THING
SOUNDS SKETCHY TO ME, GUYS.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.747
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:21.041
THERE'S A DUNGEON IN THE SKY
WITH EXCALIBUR LOCKED UP

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:23.085
AT THE BOTTOM OF IT.
TO GET TO IT,

00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:25.337
YOU GOTTA FIGHT YOUR WAY
THROUGH A BUNCH OF MONSTERS.

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:28.173
BUT NOW WE GOT AN NPC
OFFERING IT UP

00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:30.092
AS A KILL‐QUEST REWARD?
THAT'S BIZARRE.

00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:32.136
Silica: NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

00:08:32.177 --> 00:08:33.762
‐ THAT IS WEIRD.
‐ Pina: (COOS)

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:36.473
Silica: THE NPC's NOT
SHOWING ANYONE TO THE DUNGEON,

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:37.725
BUT THAT'S WHERE THE SWORD IS.

00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:40.102
All: ( SIGH )

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:42.062
Sinon: WELL, I'M SURE
WE'LL FIND OUT WHY

00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:43.105
ONCE WE GET THERE.

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:45.816
Lisbeth: ALL RIGHTY.

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:48.736
YOUR WEAPONS ARE ALL RESTORED
AND READY FOR ACTION.

00:09:01.543 --> 00:09:02.962
Klein: EVEN THOUGH
OUR PARTY'S FULL OF HOTNESS,

00:09:03.003 --> 00:09:04.921
WE'RE STILL A BUNCH
OF GEAR‐TOTING MEATHEADS.

00:09:05.463 --> 00:09:06.923
Lisbeth: IF YOU
WANNA SWITCH IT UP,

00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:08.341
YOU COULD ALWAYS
BOOST YOUR MAGIC.

00:09:08.383 --> 00:09:10.009
Klein: HA! KEEP DREAMING.

00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.596
A REAL SAMURAI, HE WOULDN'T
BE CAUGHT DEAD USING MAGIC.

00:09:13.638 --> 00:09:15.014
CODE OF HONOR.

00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:16.683
Lisbeth: CODE OF HONOR, HUH?

00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:19.352
KNOW WHAT SAMURAI'S ARE
CLASSIFIED AS IN RPGs?

00:09:19.394 --> 00:09:21.688
THEY'RE BOTH WARRIORS
AND BLACK‐MAGIC USERS.

00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:24.023
Klein: PLEASE.
I'D RATHER BUST MY SWORD

00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:26.442
AND QUIT BEING A SAMURAI
THAN USE MAGIC, DOLL.

00:09:26.484 --> 00:09:29.195
Silica: I DON'T KNOW, KLEIN.
IF I REMEMBER RIGHT,

00:09:29.237 --> 00:09:32.073
DIDN'T YOU USE A FLAME‐SWORD
SKILL THE OTHER DAY?

00:09:32.115 --> 00:09:34.659
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ACTIVATE IT,
YOU ARE USING PART MAGIC.

00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:36.411
Klein: NO WAY. REALLY?

00:09:36.452 --> 00:09:39.622
Yui: YES, KLEIN.
WHAT SILICA SAID IS TRUE.

00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:41.207
REMEMBER THE MAY UPDATE?

00:09:41.249 --> 00:09:44.168
IT BROUGHT A WHOLE BUNCH
OF NEW SWORD SKILLS TO A.L.O.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.046
SOME ARE PHYSICAL,
AND OTHERS ARE ADVANCED,

00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:51.175
LIKE EARTH, WATER, FIRE,
WIND, DARK, AND DIVINE,

00:09:51.217 --> 00:09:53.177
ALL OF WHICH
ARE MAGICAL ATTRIBUTES.

00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:56.264
Klein: FIRE'S MAGICAL, TOO, HUH?

00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:57.390
Lisbeth: OKAY, EX‐SAMURAI,

00:09:57.432 --> 00:09:59.225
YOU NEED HELP
BUSTING THAT SWORD?

00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:00.768
Klein: (GASPS)

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.812
DUDE, BACK ME UP HERE.

00:10:02.854 --> 00:10:05.857
Kirito: WELL, SINCE YOU DON'T
CHANT WHEN USING SWORD SKILLS,

00:10:05.898 --> 00:10:07.734
I GUESS IT'S NOT THE SAME.

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:10.194
Lisbeth: I'LL LET IT
SLIDE THIS TIME. HEH.

00:10:10.236 --> 00:10:11.362
Klein: (SIGHS)

00:10:11.404 --> 00:10:13.114
Yui: (GIGGLES)

00:10:13.156 --> 00:10:16.117
Kirito: I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU GUYS HELPING ME OUT

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:17.827
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:21.372
SERIOUSLY, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME.

00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:23.499
ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU READY?

00:10:23.541 --> 00:10:25.543
All: YEAH!

00:10:26.544 --> 00:10:28.463
(FOOTSTEPS CLACKING)

00:10:28.504 --> 00:10:30.465
Lisbeth: GOD.

00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:33.468
HOW MANY STEPS DOES
THIS THING HAVE, ANYWAY?

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:37.138
Leafa: I KNOW. I BET THE TOWER
ON THE DUNGEON FLOOR

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.350
OF NEW AINCRAD DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE AS MANY AS THIS.

00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:42.935
Kirito: OH, COME ON.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

00:10:42.977 --> 00:10:45.021
IF WE TOOK THE NORMAL ROUTE
TO JOTUNHEIM,

00:10:45.063 --> 00:10:46.606
IT'D TAKE AT LEAST TWO HOURS.

00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:48.107
THIS WAY,
IT'S JUST FIVE MINUTES.

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:50.234
INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE STEPS,

00:10:50.276 --> 00:10:51.903
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME

00:10:51.944 --> 00:10:53.571
FOR SHOWING YOU GUYS
THIS RAD SHORTCUT.

00:10:53.613 --> 00:10:54.906
Sinon: YEAH, YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:10:54.947 --> 00:10:56.574
IT'S STILL A PAIN IN THE BUTT.

00:10:56.616 --> 00:10:58.159
Kirito: I GOT YOUR PAIN
IN THE BUTT.

00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:01.037
Sinon: (GASPS, SHRIEKS)

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:03.039
WHY, YOU...

00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:04.540
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:06.125
Sinon: DUMB‐ASS.
DO THAT AGAIN,

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:08.711
AND YOU GET A FIRE ARROW
IN YOUR PIEHOLE.

00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:10.838
Pina: (COOS)

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.759

YOU GOT BALLS OF STEEL, NO JOKE.

00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:27.855

Pina: (COOS)

00:11:28.898 --> 00:11:30.233

Klein: (SHIVERING)

00:11:42.203 --> 00:11:43.454
AREN'T YOU COLD?

00:11:46.332 --> 00:11:50.711
Asuna: OATH, SHARLE, RAISE,
VIND, BARD, HARL‐CA, STOLES.

00:11:54.507 --> 00:11:55.716
BETTER?

00:11:55.758 --> 00:11:59.095
I CAST A FREEZE‐RESISTANCE SPELL
OVER US.

Yui: TONKY, UP HERE!

00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:20.992
Klein: JESUS. (SHIVERS)

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:22.702
Kirito: TAKE IT EASY, KLEIN.

00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:25.371
HE DOESN'T LOOK IT,
BUT HE'S A VEGETARIAN.

00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:26.747
Leafa: WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:29.000
WHEN I BROUGHT HIM SOME FISH
FROM ABOVEGROUND,

00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:31.210
HE SCARFED IT ALL DOWN
IN ONE BITE.

00:12:31.252 --> 00:12:32.420
Klein: UH‐OH.

00:12:32.462 --> 00:12:34.338
WHAT'S HE DOING?

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.467
Kirito: HE'S TELLING YOU
TO GET ON HIS BACK IS ALL.

00:12:37.508 --> 00:12:39.927
Klein: DUDE, NO WAY.
NO WAY IN HELL.

00:12:39.969 --> 00:12:42.972
MY GRANDPA'S DYING WORDS
WERE DON'T RIDE IN FOREIGN CARS

00:12:43.014 --> 00:12:44.474
OR ON FLYING CTHULHU ELEPHANTS.

00:12:44.515 --> 00:12:46.642
Kirito: IS HE
THE SAME DEAD GRANDPA

00:12:46.684 --> 00:12:49.479
WHOSE DRIED FIGS WE WERE EATING
AT DICEY'S THE OTHER DAY?

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.022
STOP FARTING AROUND,
AND GET ON.

00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:53.107
Klein: IF IT EATS ME, MAN...

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:56.652
Lisbeth: THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

00:12:56.694 --> 00:12:57.987
Klein: WE'RE SO DEAD.

00:12:58.029 --> 00:13:00.865
Kirito: THANKS A LOT
FOR DOING THIS, TONKY.

00:13:05.077 --> 00:13:06.537
Leafa: ALL RIGHT, TONKY.

00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:09.207
EVERYONE'S ONBOARD,
SO TAKE US TO THAT DUNGEON!

Tonky: (TRUMPETS)

00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:24.598
Lisbeth: WOW.
I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.600
IF YOU FELL FROM WAY UP HERE?

00:13:26.642 --> 00:13:28.144
Asuna: THE SAME THING
THAT HAPPENED

00:13:28.185 --> 00:13:30.020
WHEN A CERTAIN SOMEONE
DECIDED TO GET

00:13:30.062 --> 00:13:32.648
TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF AINCRAD
BY CLIMBING THE OUTER PILLARS.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.484
SO HOW 'BOUT IT, WONDER KLUTZ?
CARE TO SHOW THE LADY?

00:13:35.526 --> 00:13:36.944
Kirito: NAH. I THINK I'LL PASS.

00:13:36.986 --> 00:13:38.988
BUT MAYBE ONE OF OUR
MORE CATLIKE FRIENDS

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:40.573
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A SHOT.

00:13:40.614 --> 00:13:41.991

NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.

THEY FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE
THAT MONSTER FIGHT FOR THEM.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.615
Silica: NO, THERE'S GOTTA
BE ANOTHER REASON.

00:14:22.656 --> 00:14:24.950
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
TO TAME MONSTERS IN THIS GAME,

00:14:24.992 --> 00:14:27.369
NOT EVEN IF YOU'RE
A CAIT SITH MASTER TAMER

LEECHING OFF THE MONSTER?

NO, WAIT. THEY'RE NOT LEECHING.

WHEN THEY GET AN OPENING.

00:14:42.468 --> 00:14:46.096

TO CONTROL A MONSTER'S AGGRO?

00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:47.431
IT'S IGNORING EVERYONE ELSE.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.925
IT SHOULD BE
PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT IT IS.

I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT WE'RE LOOKING

I AM URD, QUEEN OF THE LAKE.

YOU HAVE BONDED WITH MY KINSMAN,

Yui: DADDY, SHE'S AN NPC.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.470
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE
ABOUT HER, THOUGH.

00:16:08.512 --> 00:16:10.848
HER SPEECH PATTERN
DOESN'T FOLLOW

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.518
THE SAME SET RESPONSE ROUTINES
THAT A NORMAL NPC's WOULD.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.186

TO THE LANGUAGE ENGINE MODULE
OF THE GAME.

00:16:19.273 --> 00:16:20.816
Kirito: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:16:20.858 --> 00:16:22.401
IS SHE SOME KIND OF A.I.?

00:16:22.443 --> 00:16:23.903
Yui: YES, DADDY, SHE IS.

00:16:23.944 --> 00:16:25.321
Urd: IN THE PAST,

00:16:25.362 --> 00:16:27.990
JOTUNHEIM WAS SIMILAR
TO YOUR ALFHEIM,

00:16:28.032 --> 00:16:31.035
COVERED IN LUSH GREENERY
AND BEAUTIFUL LAKES.

00:16:31.076 --> 00:16:34.830
IT BASKED IN THE BLESSINGS
OF YGGDRASIL, THE WORLD TREE.

00:16:34.872 --> 00:16:37.833
WE, THE HILL GIANTS,

00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:39.752
LIVED IN PEACE AND HARMONY

00:16:39.793 --> 00:16:42.338
WITH OUR KINFOLK, THE CREATURES.

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:46.383
FAR BELOW
THE SPLENDOR OF JOTUNHEIM

00:16:46.425 --> 00:16:49.762
IS A REALM OF ICE AND SNOW
KNOWN AS NIFLHEIM.

00:16:49.803 --> 00:16:52.264
THRYMR,
KING OF THE FROST GIANTS,

00:16:52.306 --> 00:16:53.766
RULES THAT LAND.

00:16:53.807 --> 00:16:57.061
HE SHATTERED OUR PEACE
BY CASTING EXCALIBUR,

00:16:57.102 --> 00:16:59.730
THE SWORD THAT SLICES
THROUGH WOOD AND IRON,

00:16:59.772 --> 00:17:01.899
INTO THE WELL OF URD,

00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:03.651
THE HEART OF OUR LAND.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.072
IT SEVERED THE THICKEST ROOTS
OF THE WORLD TREE.

00:17:08.113 --> 00:17:11.533
IN AN INSTANT,
JOTUNHEIM LOST THE BLESSINGS

00:17:11.575 --> 00:17:13.535
IT RECEIVED FROM YGGDRASIL.

00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:34.473
Kirito: I WAS RIGHT, EXCALIBUR.

00:17:36.558 --> 00:17:37.977
Urd: UNDER THRYMR'S COMMAND,

00:17:38.018 --> 00:17:40.688
THE FROST GIANTS
MARCHED ON JOTUNHEIM

00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:42.773
AND OVERWHELMED OUR DEFENSES.

00:17:42.815 --> 00:17:45.943
THEIR FORTRESSES AND CASTLES
SOON BLIGHTED OUR LAND,

00:17:45.985 --> 00:17:50.114
AND SCORES OF MY PEOPLE
WERE CAPTURED AND IMPRISONED.

00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:51.907
ONCE THEY SEIZED CONTROL,

00:17:51.949 --> 00:17:54.535
THEY BUILT THRYMHEIM,
THEIR LARGEST CASTLE,

00:17:54.576 --> 00:17:59.039
ATOP THE MASS OF ICE
ONCE KNOWN AS THE WELL OF URD.

00:17:59.081 --> 00:18:01.792
DURING THE CHAOS,
MY SISTERS AND I

00:18:01.834 --> 00:18:04.420
ESCAPED TO THE BOTTOM
OF A FROZEN LAKE.

00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:08.048
HOWEVER, WE NO LONGER
HAVE THE POWER WE ONCE HAD.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:12.469
THE FROST GIANTS ARE NOT
SATISFIED WITH THEIR SPOILS.

00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:14.847
THEY WISH TO ANNIHILATE OUR KIN,

00:18:14.888 --> 00:18:17.975
THE CREATURES
THAT POPULATE OUR REALM.

00:18:18.017 --> 00:18:21.645
IF THEY SUCCEED, MY POWERS
WILL BE EXTINGUISHED,

00:18:21.687 --> 00:18:25.024
AND THRYMHEIM WILL RISE
TO THE NEXT WORLD,

00:18:25.065 --> 00:18:28.068
YOUR WORLD, ALFHEIM.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.653
Klein: (GASPS) HOLD THE PHONE.

00:18:29.695 --> 00:18:31.697
YOU'RE TELLING US
THAT ONCE THEY'RE DONE HERE,

00:18:31.739 --> 00:18:33.324
THEY'RE GONNA GO UP
AND DESTROY ARUN?

00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:35.659
Urd: YES, THAT IS
THEIR INTENTION.

00:18:35.659 --> 00:18:39.872
KING THRYMR WILL SEAL ALFHEIM
IN ICE AND CONTINUE ON

00:18:39.913 --> 00:18:42.333
UNTIL HE REACHES
THE TOP OF YGGDRASIL.

00:18:44.043 --> 00:18:45.711
ONCE HE REACHES IT,

00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:48.088
HE WILL TAKE
THE GOLDEN APPLE GROWING THERE.

00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:51.967
THRYMR AND HIS GENERALS
HAVE GROWN FRUSTRATED

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:55.012
BY THE TIME IT IS TAKING
TO WIPE OUT MY KINFOLK,

00:18:55.054 --> 00:18:57.556
SO THEY HAVE TURNED
TO YOUR PEOPLE, THE FAERIES,

00:18:57.598 --> 00:19:01.847
FOR ASSISTANCE
IN THEIR MURDEROUS PLOT.

00:19:01.888 --> 00:19:04.975
YOUR KIND HUNTS
OUR KINFOLK TO EXTINCTION,

00:19:05.017 --> 00:19:07.692
LURED BY THE OFFER
OF EXCALIBUR AS A REWARD.

00:19:08.985 --> 00:19:11.445
HOWEVER, KING THRYMR

00:19:11.487 --> 00:19:14.573
CANNOT BESTOW
THAT SWORD UNTO OTHERS,

00:19:14.615 --> 00:19:17.535
FOR IF EXCALIBUR
EVER LEAVES THRYMHEIM,

00:19:17.576 --> 00:19:20.663
THE BLESSINGS OF YGGDRASIL
WILL RETURN TO THIS LAND,

00:19:20.705 --> 00:19:24.333
AND THEIR CASTLE WILL VANISH
AS A MIST UPON A MEADOW.

00:19:24.375 --> 00:19:26.669
Lisbeth: BUT‐‐BUT THEN...

00:19:26.711 --> 00:19:29.880
WHAT KIND OF QUEST IS IT WHEN
THE REWARD FOR IT'S A TOTAL LIE?

00:19:29.922 --> 00:19:31.716
HOW IS HE GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT?

00:19:31.757 --> 00:19:34.260
Urd: MOST LIKELY,
HE WILL AWARD THE VICTOR

00:19:34.302 --> 00:19:35.594
A SWORD CALLED CALIBURN,

00:19:35.636 --> 00:19:38.180
WHOSE APPEARANCE
IS IDENTICAL TO EXCALIBUR.

00:19:38.222 --> 00:19:39.765
Leafa: BUT THAT'S CHEATING.

00:19:39.807 --> 00:19:41.892
IF HE'S A KING, DOESN'T HE
HAVE A CODE OF HONOR?

00:19:41.934 --> 00:19:44.895
Urd: UNFORTUNATELY,
CHEATING AND FALSEHOODS

00:19:44.937 --> 00:19:47.606
ARE THRYMR'S
MOST POWERFUL ASSETS.

00:19:47.648 --> 00:19:51.610
HOWEVER, HE HAS MADE
ONE GREAT MISTAKE.

00:19:51.652 --> 00:19:53.988
IN HIS EAGERNESS
TO SLAUGHTER MY KIN,

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.658
HE HAS SENT A NUMBER OF
HIS GIANTS DOWN FROM THRYMHEIM

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.452
TO MARSHAL YOUR KIND FOR BATTLE.

00:19:59.493 --> 00:20:01.954
AT THIS MOMENT,
THE DEFENSES OF HIS CASTLE

00:20:01.996 --> 00:20:03.789
ARE WEAKER
THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN.

00:20:03.831 --> 00:20:05.666
Kirito: THERE'S OUR SHOT.

00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:16.093
Urd: ONCE THE STONE
IN THE AMULET TURNS BLACK,

00:20:16.135 --> 00:20:19.388
IT WILL MEAN ALL MY KINFOLK
HAVE BEEN SLAIN

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.849
AND MY POWERS HAVE LEFT ME.

00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:25.436
GOOD FAERIES,
INFILTRATE THRYMHEIM,

00:20:25.478 --> 00:20:27.646
REMOVE EXCALIBUR
FROM ITS PLINTH,

00:20:27.688 --> 00:20:29.357
AND SAVE MY REALM.

00:20:32.902 --> 00:20:36.197
I AM COUNTING ON YOU,
GOOD FAERIES.

00:20:38.407 --> 00:20:41.118
Tonky: (BELLOWS)

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.415
Asuna: THIS IS TURNING INTO
A BIGGER DEAL THAN WE THOUGHT.

00:20:46.457 --> 00:20:48.918
Sinon: IS THIS STILL
CONSIDERED A QUEST?

00:20:48.959 --> 00:20:51.128
'CAUSE IT'S KINDA TURNED INTO

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.923
SOMETHING WAY MORE EPIC
THAN A PLAIN OLD QUEST.

00:20:53.964 --> 00:20:55.800
YOU HEARD HER. SHE SAID

00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:58.594
IF THE CREATURES IN THIS WORLD
GET KILLED OFF,

00:20:58.636 --> 00:21:01.097
THE FROST GIANTS'LL TAKE OVER
THE SURFACE NEXT.

00:21:01.138 --> 00:21:02.431
Kirito: YEAH, I KNOW,

00:21:02.473 --> 00:21:05.267
BUT I DOUBT THE ADMINS
WOULD LET THAT HAPPEN

00:21:05.309 --> 00:21:08.187
WITHOUT SOME KIND OF UPDATE
OR WARNING OR SOMETHING.

00:21:08.229 --> 00:21:10.106
I MEAN, NORMALLY,

00:21:10.147 --> 00:21:12.900
THEY'D LET PLAYERS KNOW
A WEEK AHEAD OF TIME.

00:21:12.942 --> 00:21:16.821
Leafa: WHATEVER. WE'RE GONNA
FINISH THIS QUEST FOR TONKY.

00:21:16.862 --> 00:21:17.822
RIGHT, KAZUTO?

00:21:17.863 --> 00:21:18.906
Kirito: YOU KNOW IT.

00:21:18.948 --> 00:21:20.533
WE WERE GONNA STORM THE CASTLE

00:21:20.574 --> 00:21:22.201
AND GRAB EXCALIBUR ANYWAY.

00:21:22.243 --> 00:21:25.162
IT'LL BE EASY IF
THE CASTLE'S DEFENSES ARE DOWN.

00:21:25.204 --> 00:21:28.457
HELPING TONKY AND HIS FRIENDS
OUT, THAT'S A BONUS.

00:21:31.419 --> 00:21:32.628
Kirito: HERE WE GO, GUYS!

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.505
OUR LAST BIG QUEST OF THE YEAR!

00:21:34.547 --> 00:21:36.590
LET'S SPANK THIS THING
AND SCORE US A SPOT

00:21:36.632 --> 00:21:38.968
ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF MMO TOMORROW!

00:21:39.009 --> 00:21:40.428
All: YEAH!

00:21:41.512 --> 00:21:44.723
Tonky: (BELLOWS)

00:21:46.016 --> 00:21:47.643
Leafa: DON'T YOU WORRY, TONKY.

00:21:47.685 --> 00:21:49.979
WE'LL GET
YOUR HOME BACK FOR YOU.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.605
IT'LL BE GOOD AS NEW. PROMISE.

00:22:00.406 --> 00:22:02.491
Kirito: HERE WE GO.
