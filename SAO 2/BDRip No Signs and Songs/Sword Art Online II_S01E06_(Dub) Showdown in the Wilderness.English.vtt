WEBVTT

00:00:02.842 --> 00:00:04.469
Death Gun: WITH THAT NAME

00:00:04.511 --> 00:00:07.639
AND YOUR SWORD SKILLS,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.100
ARE YOU THE REAL DEAL OR WHAT?

00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:14.395
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:23.279
Kirito: IF HE KNOWS ME,
I SHOULD KNOW HIM.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.742
THAT'S IT.

00:00:27.784 --> 00:00:31.120
HE'S AN S.A.O. SURVIVOR.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.544
WHO IS HE,

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:41.339
AND WHERE DID WE MEET
IN S.A.O.?

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:49.472
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:29.887
Death Gun: ANSWER THE QUESTION.

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.765
OR DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:01:32.807 --> 00:01:34.767
Kirito: NO, I DON'T.

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:38.438
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "REAL DEAL"?

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.189
Death Gun: NEVER MIND.

00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:43.359
WHETHER YOU'RE
A FAKE USING HIS NAME

00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:45.445
OR THE REAL GUY,

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:48.781
SOMEDAY I'LL KILL YOU.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.922
Kirito: (PANTING)

00:03:46.818 --> 00:03:48.820
Kirito: (PANTING)

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:55.160
LAUGHING COFFIN.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.953
THE EMBLEM ON HIS WRIST

00:03:56.995 --> 00:04:00.206
BELONGED TO THE MURDER GUILD
FROM S.A.O.

00:04:00.748 --> 00:04:03.167
LAUGHING COFFIN.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.004
GOD KNOWS HOW MANY PLAYERS
THEY KILLED IN THEIR TIME.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:10.299
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES

00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:12.927
GUILTY OF MURDER.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.387
(GASPS)

00:04:50.047 --> 00:04:52.049
Schmidt:
IF THE TIP WE GOT'S GOOD,

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.260
WE SHOULD BE NEAR
LAUGHING COFFIN'S BASE,

00:04:54.302 --> 00:04:57.805
BUT BEFORE WE CHARGE IN,
LET'S KEEP ONE THING IN MIND.

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.350
THOSE GUYS ARE RED PLAYERS.

00:05:01.392 --> 00:05:03.060
ONCE THE BATTLE STARTS,

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:06.439
THEY'RE NOT GONNA THINK TWICE
ABOUT KILLING ANY ONE OF US,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.065
SO DON'T YOU HESITATE.

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:09.525
YOU DO, AND YOU'RE DEAD.

00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:11.110
Player: (GASPS)

00:05:11.152 --> 00:05:13.779
Schmidt: WE'VE GOT TWO THINGS
GOING FOR US, THOUGH.

00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:16.782
WE OUTNUMBER THEM, AND WE'VE
GOT HIGHER SKILL LEVELS.

00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:19.702
SO WHO KNOWS? MAYBE THEY'LL
SURRENDER PEACEFULLY.

00:05:19.744 --> 00:05:22.163
HELL, A GUY CAN DREAM, CAN'T HE?

00:05:22.204 --> 00:05:25.249
Players: (LAUGH)

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:35.051
Players: (GRUNTING, YELLING)

00:05:44.685 --> 00:05:46.187
Schmidt: DAMN IT.

00:05:46.228 --> 00:05:49.774
SOMEONE MUST HAVE LEAKED
OUR PLANS TO THESE BASTARDS!

00:05:53.778 --> 00:05:55.363
Player 2: (CHUCKLES)

00:06:11.253 --> 00:06:13.464
Kirito:
THEY CAUGHT US OFF GUARD,

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.716
BUT WE REGROUPED IN TIME.

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:17.385
WE CAN DO THIS.

00:06:27.895 --> 00:06:29.188
Player 3: YOU'RE OUTNUMBERED.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.940
SURRENDER NOW, OR ELSE.

00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.317
Player 4: COME ON.
DROP YOUR SWORD.

00:06:34.318 --> 00:06:35.361
Player 3: DO IT!

00:06:35.403 --> 00:06:36.654
YOU CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER HIT!

00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:38.864
Player 4: DROP THE SWORD NOW!

00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:42.660
Player 5: (LAUGHING)

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:50.334
Player 4: (SCREAMS)

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:51.669
(SWORD SLASHES)

00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:54.797
Player 5: (CHUCKLING)

00:06:58.425 --> 00:07:00.136
Player 6: (GROANS, GURGLES)

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:16.694
Kirito: IT TURNED INTO

00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:19.530
A BLOOD‐SOAKED NIGHTMARE
AFTER THAT.

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.949
WE WON THE BATTLE,

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:23.993
BUT BY THE TIME IT WAS OVER,

00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:26.287
WE'D LOST TEN OF OURS.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.832
AS FOR LAUGHING COFFIN,

00:07:29.874 --> 00:07:33.460
TWENTY OF THEM REFUSED
TO SURRENDER AND WERE KILLED.

00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:36.463
OUT OF THAT TWENTY,

00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:41.886
TWO LIVES WERE CLAIMED
BY MY SWORD.

00:07:48.294 --> 00:07:49.795
THAT GUY...

00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:53.215
IF HE'S ONE OF THE SURVIVORS
FROM LAUGHING COFFIN,

00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:58.095
THEN HE MUST HAVE TALKED TO ME
AT SOME POINT AFTER THAT BATTLE,

00:07:58.137 --> 00:08:03.225
OR MAYBE HE'S ONE
OF THE TWO PEOPLE I KILLED.

00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:06.687
NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:08.314
THAT'S CRAZY.

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:11.900
Death Gun: ...THE NAME I SHARE
WITH THIS WEAPON, DEATH GUN.

00:08:11.942 --> 00:08:13.986
Kirito: OH MY GOD.

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:16.697
HIS VOICE WAS
THE SAME AS DEATH GUN'S.

00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:19.366
WAS THAT HIM?

00:08:19.408 --> 00:08:22.828
COULD HE BE DEATH GUN?

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.671
Sinon: YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE IT.

00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:34.340
Kirito: NO, I'M OKAY.

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:37.676
Sinon: GUESS YOUR FIRST MATCH
WAS TOUGHER THAN YOU THOUGHT.

00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:39.595
YOU GOT BACK
PRETTY EARLY, THOUGH.

00:08:39.637 --> 00:08:41.597
NOT TOO SHABBY FOR A NOOB.

00:08:43.098 --> 00:08:45.643
GOD, IF YOU'RE LIKE THIS
AFTER ONE MATCH,

00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:47.895
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT
TO THE FINALS.

00:08:47.937 --> 00:08:50.105
YOU BETTER MAN UP, GUY.

00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:52.358
REMEMBER, WE GOT
THINGS TO SETTLE.

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:57.279
HEY, LET GO!

00:09:07.331 --> 00:09:08.666
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

00:09:11.627 --> 00:09:13.504
ARE YOU OKA‐‐

00:09:44.702 --> 00:09:46.996
(GUN CLINKS)

00:09:58.298 --> 00:10:01.218
Kirito: (SCREAMS)

00:10:16.734 --> 00:10:19.319
Player 7: THAT PLAYER
GOT A DEATH WISH OR WHAT?

00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:20.738
Spiegel: HMM.

00:10:30.622 --> 00:10:31.623
Player 8: WHA?

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.462
Players: (GASPING)

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.422
Spiegel: HUH. I CAN'T BELIEVE

00:10:38.464 --> 00:10:40.632
HE KEEPS WINNING
FIGHTING LIKE THAT.

00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:43.052
HIS NEXT MATCH
IS IN THE SEMIFINALS.

00:10:44.762 --> 00:10:47.598
YOURS IS, TOO,
SO GET OUT THERE AND ROCK.

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:48.640
GOOD LUCK.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.736
Sinon: STINGER IS MY TARGET.

00:11:00.778 --> 00:11:04.114
HIS MAIN WEAPON IS
AN FN‐SCAR CARBINE RIFLE.

00:11:04.156 --> 00:11:07.451
AS A SNIPER,
IF I LET HIM GET TOO CLOSE,

00:11:07.493 --> 00:11:08.952
I'M DONE FOR.

00:11:08.994 --> 00:11:10.287
BUT ON THIS MAP,

00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:12.623
IF HE WANTS TO CLOSE IN ON ME,

00:11:12.664 --> 00:11:14.666
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THERE,

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:16.752
AND THAT'S
WHERE I'LL TAKE HIM OUT.

00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:29.932
(SIGHS) DAMN HIM.

00:11:43.237 --> 00:11:45.864
HE WANTED ME TO WASTE
MY FIRST SHOT

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:48.534
TO BUY HIM TIME
SO HE COULD ADVANCE.

00:11:51.537 --> 00:11:53.330
TOO BAD FOR HIM,

00:11:53.372 --> 00:11:56.333
'CAUSE I KNOW THE PATH
MY FIRST BULLET TOOK.

00:11:56.375 --> 00:12:00.170
MY SECOND ONE'LL BE
RIGHT ON TARGET.

00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:14.017
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOT
OUT OF THE CAR, BUDDY.

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:16.103
IF YOU DID, YOU MIGHT HAVE
SEEN THE BULLET LINE

00:12:16.145 --> 00:12:17.187
IN TIME TO DODGE IT.

00:12:17.229 --> 00:12:19.231
(FANFARE PLAYING)

00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:13.178
Sinon: HE'S GONNA TRY
AND CLOSE IN ON ME

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.888
USING THE SHADOWS FOR COVER.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.975
MY ONLY CHANCE IS NAILING HIM
WITH THE FIRST SHOT,

00:13:18.017 --> 00:13:20.144
BEFORE HE FIGURES OUT
MY LOCATION.

00:13:22.062 --> 00:13:24.398
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIT HIM.

00:13:29.778 --> 00:13:30.863
WHAT'S MY PROBLEM?

00:13:30.904 --> 00:13:33.866
WHY DO I WANT
TO BEAT HIM SO BAD?

00:13:35.075 --> 00:13:38.620
IS IT 'CAUSE HE
REMINDS ME OF ME?

00:13:48.047 --> 00:13:52.051
DOES HE THINK HE CAN DODGE
MY BULLET AT THIS RANGE?

00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:10.152
DOES HE EVEN WANT TO?

00:14:10.194 --> 00:14:12.029
(HEART BEATING)

00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:17.201
DON'T...

00:14:18.869 --> 00:14:20.454
DON'T‐‐

00:14:20.496 --> 00:14:22.414
DON'T SCREW WITH ME!

00:14:46.563 --> 00:14:48.482
(SHELL CLATTERS)

00:15:15.926 --> 00:15:17.010
FIGHT ME.

00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:18.470
COME ON, FIGHT!

00:15:18.512 --> 00:15:21.473
OR MAYBE YOU THINK
I'M NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.

00:15:21.515 --> 00:15:23.475
Kirito: YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.

00:15:23.517 --> 00:15:26.478
ALL I WANT
IS TO COMPETE IN THE FINAL.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.480
THERE'S NO REASON
TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

00:15:28.522 --> 00:15:30.065
Sinon: THEN GO ON
AND SHOOT YOURSELF,

00:15:30.107 --> 00:15:31.233
AND GET IT OVER WITH!

00:15:31.275 --> 00:15:32.943
OR WOULD THAT BE
A WASTE OF AMMO?

00:15:32.985 --> 00:15:35.362
OR MAYBE YOU WANTED ME
TO SHOOT YOU

00:15:35.404 --> 00:15:38.407
'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD
EVEN THE SCORE BETWEEN US.

00:15:38.448 --> 00:15:40.409
TO YOU, IT'S JUST A GAME,

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.744
JUST ONE STUPID MATCH.

00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:46.415
THAT'S ALL IT IS TO YOU,
IS THAT IT, A GAME?

00:15:46.456 --> 00:15:50.460
WELL, JUST 'CAUSE YOU FEEL
THAT WAY DOESN'T MEAN I DO!

00:15:50.502 --> 00:15:54.882
BUT IF WE DO MEET IN THE FINAL
BRACKET OF THE PRELIMS,

00:15:54.923 --> 00:15:56.842
I'LL BE PLAYING TO WIN.

00:15:56.884 --> 00:15:59.261
Kirito: OH. I GET IT.

00:15:59.303 --> 00:16:02.681
ALL RIGHT, IF WE BOTH MAKE IT,
NO HOLDING BACK.

00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:10.439
I'M SORRY.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.900
WHAT I DID WAS WRONG.

00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:14.776
SURE, IT'S A GAME.

00:16:14.818 --> 00:16:16.361
IT'S ONLY ONE MATCH.

00:16:16.403 --> 00:16:20.741
BUT STILL, THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO GIVE IT ALL WE GOT.

00:16:20.782 --> 00:16:22.159
IT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:24.870
IT'S HOW WE LIVE,
HOW WE KEEP SURVIVING.

00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:29.041
IF ANYONE SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN THAT, IT'S ME.

00:16:31.084 --> 00:16:34.713
SINON, GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO MAKE IT RIGHT WITH YOU.

00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:37.424
LET ME GIVE YOU
THE FIGHT I PROMISED.

00:16:37.466 --> 00:16:40.886
Sinon: I SWEAR,
IF YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME...

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.276
Kirito: YOU GOT ANY BULLETS
LEFT ON YOU, OR ARE YOU OUT?

00:16:56.318 --> 00:16:57.986
Sinon: YEAH, I GOT ONE.

00:16:58.028 --> 00:17:01.490
Kirito: OKAY,
THEN LET'S HAVE A DUEL.

00:17:01.531 --> 00:17:02.950
HERE'S THE RULES.

00:17:02.991 --> 00:17:04.618
WE'LL STAND TEN METERS APART,

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.621
YOU WITH YOUR RIFLE,
AND ME WITH MY SWORD.

00:17:07.663 --> 00:17:09.206
I'LL TOSS THIS BULLET UP,

00:17:09.248 --> 00:17:11.792
AND WHEN IT HITS THE GROUND,
WE START.

00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:13.252
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:17:13.293 --> 00:17:14.628
Sinon: HANG ON.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.755
IF WE'RE TEN METERS
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER,

00:17:16.797 --> 00:17:20.509
IT WON'T GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO
SEE THE BULLET LINE AND REACT,

00:17:20.551 --> 00:17:23.178
AND WITH MY HECATE,
I'LL DEFINITELY HIT YOU.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.389
AT THAT RANGE, I CAN'T MISS.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.267
Kirito: YOU WON'T KNOW FOR SURE
TILL YOU TRY.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.104
Sinon: WHY'S HE ACTING
SO CONFIDENT?

00:17:32.145 --> 00:17:35.941
DOES HE HAVE A PLAN
OR SOMETHING?

00:17:35.983 --> 00:17:39.903
WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M READY FOR IT.

00:17:39.945 --> 00:17:41.238
OKAY.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.783
IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT IT,
LET'S GO.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.975
I KNEW IT.

00:18:10.017 --> 00:18:11.810
HE DOES HAVE A PLAN.

00:18:16.315 --> 00:18:18.108
Kirito: 'KAY. GET SET.

00:18:58.523 --> 00:18:59.483
Sinon: NO WAY.

00:18:59.524 --> 00:19:01.777
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:19:16.458 --> 00:19:18.919
YOU KNEW WHERE I WAS AIMING.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.214
BUT HOW? HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WAS GOING FOR YOUR LEG?

00:19:22.255 --> 00:19:24.966
Kirito: I KNEW,
'CAUSE I COULD SEE YOUR EYE

00:19:25.008 --> 00:19:26.718
THROUGH THE LENS OF YOUR SCOPE.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.847
Sinon: THAT'S HOW HE
PREDICTED MY BULLET'S PATH?

00:19:30.889 --> 00:19:33.058
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.979
THAT KIND OF POWER'S
WAY BEYOND ANY V. R. GAME.

00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:40.649
IF YOU'RE SO STRONG
YOU CAN DO THAT,

00:19:40.691 --> 00:19:42.818
WHY'D YOU LOOK SO AFRAID BEFORE?

00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:46.238
Kirito: YOU'RE WRONG.
IT'S NOT STRENGTH.

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:47.781
ALL IT IS IS A SKILL.

00:19:47.823 --> 00:19:49.950
Sinon: NO, IT'S NOT.

00:19:49.991 --> 00:19:53.954
TECHNIQUE ISN'T ENOUGH TO CUT
A BULLET FROM MY HECATE IN HALF.

00:19:53.995 --> 00:19:55.664
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT.

00:19:55.706 --> 00:19:56.915
IT TAKES STRENGTH,

00:19:56.957 --> 00:19:59.835
AND ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS HOW TO GET IT.

00:19:59.876 --> 00:20:03.797
IT'S WHAT I‐‐IT'S WHAT
I'M HERE TO FIGURE OUT.

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:07.592
Kirito: LISTEN, COULD YOU
SHOOT A PLAYER IN HERE

00:20:07.634 --> 00:20:11.638
IF YOU KNEW, IN THE REAL WORLD,
THAT PLAYER WOULD DIE FROM IT?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.391
AND WHAT IF YOU
HAD TO KILL THAT PLAYER,

00:20:14.433 --> 00:20:15.726
'CAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T,

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:18.061
YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE
WOULD DIE INSTEAD?

00:20:18.103 --> 00:20:19.813
IF YOU HAD THAT POWER,

00:20:19.855 --> 00:20:21.857
COULD YOU STILL PULL
THAT TRIGGER?

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.278
Sinon: DOES HE KNOW

00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:29.781
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME THAT DAY?

00:20:29.823 --> 00:20:34.035
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HAPPENED TO HIM, TOO.

00:20:37.038 --> 00:20:39.374
Kirito: I CAN'T
GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

00:20:40.917 --> 00:20:44.171
SO I'M NOT AS STRONG
AS YOU THINK I AM.

00:20:44.212 --> 00:20:46.840
I DON'T KNOW
THE NAMES OF THE TWO‐‐

00:20:46.882 --> 00:20:50.635
NO, THREE PEOPLE I KILLED
IN THAT OTHER GAME.

00:20:50.677 --> 00:20:54.055
I HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:20:54.097 --> 00:20:57.350
AND EVERY DAY,
I KEEP HOPING I'LL FORGET.

00:21:08.653 --> 00:21:09.613
I'M FINE.

00:21:09.654 --> 00:21:11.615
ANYWAY, I GUESS THIS MEANS

00:21:11.656 --> 00:21:13.366
I WON THE DUEL, DOESN'T IT?

00:21:13.408 --> 00:21:15.911
Sinon: HUH? OH.
YEAH, I GUESS.

00:21:15.952 --> 00:21:17.829
Kirito: WELL, WOULD YOU MIND
SURRENDERING THEN?

00:21:17.871 --> 00:21:20.290
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF SLASHING AT GIRLS.

00:21:20.332 --> 00:21:21.333
Sinon: HUH?

00:21:28.173 --> 00:21:30.759
NEXT TIME, I'M NOT GONNA LOSE.

00:21:30.801 --> 00:21:32.427
SEE YOU IN THE FINALS.

00:21:32.469 --> 00:21:35.931
AND MAKE SURE YOU SURVIVE
UNTIL YOU SEE ME AGAIN.

00:21:35.972 --> 00:21:37.265
RESIGN.

00:21:43.939 --> 00:21:45.941
Players: (GASPING)

00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:54.199
Spiegel: HUH?
