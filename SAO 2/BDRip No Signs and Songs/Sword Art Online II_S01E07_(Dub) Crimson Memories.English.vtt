WEBVTT

00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:08.264
Suguha: <i>KAZUTO!</i>

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:11.517
( CHUCKLES )

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.478
Kazuto: OKAY, WHAT'S WITH
THAT GOOFY GRIN?

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.896
Suguha: WELL...

00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:17.940
THIS MORNING,
I JUST SO HAPPENED

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:19.650
TO SEE AN INTERESTING ARTICLE.

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:23.446
AND THEN I NOTICED THAT.

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:25.114
Kazuto: OH. ( CHUCKLES )

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:26.741
WOW, WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:28.367
SOMEONE'S GOT
A SIMILAR HANDLE.

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:30.494
Suguha: YEAH, EXCEPT
THIS ISN'T SIMILAR.

00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:31.829
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:33.622
Kazuto: IF YOU'RE GONNA
PUT IT THAT WAY,

00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:35.082
THEN, YEAH, I GUESS.

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:38.461
ALTHOUGH THAT NAME'S
NOT REALLY THAT UNUSUAL.

00:00:38.502 --> 00:00:40.671
I MEAN, MINE'S AN ABBREVIATION.

00:00:40.713 --> 00:00:44.175
MAYBE THE KIRITO
IN G.G.O.'s NAME IS KIRI‐‐

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:48.220
KIRIGAMINE. YEAH,
TOUGURO KIRIGAMINE OR SOMETHING.

00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:49.221
( CHUCKLES )

00:00:49.263 --> 00:00:51.515
( CHEWING )

00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:54.226
BETTER EAT UP,
OR IT'S GONNA GET COLD.

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:35.580
Kazuto: WHO IS HE?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.752
HE'S GOTTA BE ONE
OF THE SURVIVORS FROM S.A.O.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.421
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:46.174
WE MUST HAVE FOUGHT
AT SOME POINT,

00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:49.260
AND I BET WE WERE TRYING
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:53.222
‐ Suguha: <i>KAZUTO.</i>
‐ Kazuto: ( GASPS )

00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:55.850
Suguha: YOU'RE MAKING
THAT SCARY FACE AGAIN.

00:02:55.892 --> 00:02:58.060
Kazuto: I HOPE IT'S
NOT SCARIER THAN USUAL.

00:02:58.102 --> 00:02:59.270
( LAUGHS )

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:02.523
Suguha: LOOK,
I ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:05.985
I KNOW YOU CONVERTED KIRITO
FROM A.L.O. TO G.G.O.,

00:03:06.027 --> 00:03:08.321
SO JUST DROP THE ACT
ALREADY, OKAY?

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:09.655
COME ON.

00:03:09.697 --> 00:03:11.908
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
I WOULDN'T NOTICE

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.076
WHEN YOU SUDDENLY VANISHED
FROM MY FRIEND LIST?

00:03:14.118 --> 00:03:15.369
Kazuto: I DIDN'T THINK

00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:17.163
YOU CHECKED THAT THING
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:19.290
Suguha: I DON'T. I JUST KNEW.

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:22.460
LAST NIGHT,
I GOT THIS WEIRD FEELING

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:23.669
AND CHECKED MY LIST.

00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:25.379
WHEN I SAW YOU WEREN'T ON IT,

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.883
I HEADED OVER TO YOUR ROOM AND
WAS ABOUT TO BUST THE DOOR DOWN.

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:31.761
I DIDN'T, 'CAUSE I KNEW IT'D
PISS YOU OFF SOMETHING FIERCE.

00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:34.972
I ALSO KNEW YOU'D NEVER QUIT
A.L.O. WITHOUT TELLING ME.

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.183
I FIGURED YOU MUST HAVE
A GOOD REASON,

00:03:37.224 --> 00:03:40.269
SO I CALLED ASUNA UP
TO SEE IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING.

00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:41.938
Kazuto: YOU DID?

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.606
HUH.

00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:45.149
Asuna: SORRY.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.652
I HOPE I'M NOT CALLING YOU
TOO LATE.

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:49.862
Kazuto: IT'S OKAY.
I WASN'T SLEEPING.

00:03:49.904 --> 00:03:51.447
BESIDES, I‐‐

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.115
( SIGHS ) NEVER MIND.

00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:55.242
Asuna: HONESTLY.
YOU STARTED TO SAY SOMETHING,

00:03:55.284 --> 00:03:57.119
SO JUST GO AHEAD AND SAY IT.

00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:58.996
Kazuto: I GUESS‐‐

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.916
I GUESS I WAS
JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW...

00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.210
I LIKE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:05.920
Asuna: THAT WASN'T SO HARD.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.133
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:13.010
Kazuto: NOTHING'S WRONG.
LONG DAY.

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.220
Asuna: DID SOMETHING HAPPEN

00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:16.347
IN THE GAME
YOU CONVERTED OVER TO?

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.556
Kazuto: ( GASPS )

00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:19.725
N‐NOTHING HAPPENED.

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:20.810
IT'S JUST...

00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:25.564
Asuna: IF THE NEW JOB'S
OVERLOADING YOU, I COULD HELP.

00:04:25.606 --> 00:04:27.441
Kazuto: THANKS FOR OFFERING.

00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:29.485
I GOT IT, THOUGH.

00:04:29.527 --> 00:04:33.281
BESIDES, IF YOU CONVERTED OVER,
YUI'D GET LONELY.

00:04:33.322 --> 00:04:35.116
Asuna: ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:37.785
Kazuto: YEAH.
I'LL BE BACK BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:40.121
Asuna: IF YOU NEED ME,
CALL, OKAY?

00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:41.998
Kazuto: WILL DO.

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.165
GOOD NIGHT.

00:04:43.207 --> 00:04:44.542
Asuna: GOOD NIGHT.

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:51.716
Kazuto: I CAN'T
DRAG ASUNA INTO THIS.

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:56.053
THAT GUY'S SURE TO SHOW UP
IN B.o.B.'s MAIN TOURNAMENT.

00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:59.056
I HAVE TO END THIS.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:02.518
THIS IS MY PROBLEM, NOT HERS.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.230
‐ Suguha: <i>KAZUTO.</i>
‐ Kazuto: ( GASPS )

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:10.401
Suguha: KNOW WHAT ASUNA TOLD ME?

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.611
SHE SAID NOT TO WORRY,

00:05:12.653 --> 00:05:15.239
'CAUSE ONCE YOU TORE UP G.G.O.,
YOU'D BE BACK.

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.574
SHE DIDN'T SAY IT,

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:19.577
BUT I KNEW SHE WAS
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:21.245
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:23.956
LAST NIGHT,
YOU GOT HOME SO LATE,

00:05:23.998 --> 00:05:25.958
AND WHEN I SAW YOUR FACE,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.209
I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING,

00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:29.295
'CAUSE YOU LOOKED
ALL FREAKED OUT.

00:05:29.337 --> 00:05:31.630
Kazuto: I DID? SORRY.

00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:34.133
Suguha: I HOPE YOU'RE
NOT DOING ANYTHING CRAZY,

00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:35.676
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,

00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:38.429
I COULDN'T BEAR IT
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.892
Kazuto: I'M GONNA BE FINE.
I PROMISE.

00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:45.227
TONIGHT'S THE LAST NIGHT
OF G.G.O.'s TOURNEY,

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:47.229
AND AFTER THAT, I'LL BE BACK

00:05:47.271 --> 00:05:50.232
TO A.L.O. AND HERE.

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:53.736
I'LL BE BACK, NO MATTER WHAT,

00:05:53.778 --> 00:05:55.321
SO DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

00:05:55.363 --> 00:05:56.447
Suguha: 'KAY.

00:05:57.573 --> 00:05:59.325
( GIGGLES )

00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:03.245
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:04.413
Kazuto: WHAT?

00:06:04.455 --> 00:06:05.915
Suguha: WHEN I WAS
TALKING TO ASUNA,

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:07.541
SHE JUST SO HAPPENED TO TELL ME

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:10.002
THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET
A HUGE CHECK FROM THIS NEW GIG.

00:06:10.044 --> 00:06:11.212
Kazuto: ( GASPS )

00:06:11.253 --> 00:06:13.589
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND WHEN I GET BACK,

00:06:13.631 --> 00:06:15.591
I'LL TREAT YOU
TO SOMETHING COOL.

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:17.551
Suguha: SERIOUSLY? IN THAT CASE,

00:06:17.593 --> 00:06:20.179
THERE'S THIS AWESOME
NEW NANOCARBON SHINAI

00:06:20.221 --> 00:06:21.847
I'VE HAD MY EYE ON.

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.307
Kazuto: OH. OKAY.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.060
SURE. YOU GOT IT.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:27.261
( METAL THUNKS )

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.846
Shino: THAT DUMB‐ASS.

00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:31.599
( METAL THUNKS )

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.975
HE PISSES ME OFF.

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:38.230
I'M SO MAD, I COULD KILL HIM.

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:39.898
Kyoji: TAKE IT EASY, ASADA.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.275
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:44.278
BUT IT'S WEIRD
TO SEE YOU THIS WORKED UP.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.030
Shino: YOU SAW HIM.

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.199
HE'S OBNOXIOUS, HE'S COCKY,
AND HE'S A DIRTY LIAR.

00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:52.828
HE THINKS HE'S SUCH A BIG SHOT
FIGHTING WITH A SWORD

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.621
IN G.G.O. OF ALL PLACES.

00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:57.082
HE TRICKED ME
INTO THINKING HE WAS A GIRL

00:06:57.124 --> 00:06:59.084
AND HAD ME TAKE HIM
TO THE GUN MARKET.

00:06:59.126 --> 00:07:01.003
I EVEN HELPED HIM
PICK OUT HIS GEAR.

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.421
HE THINKS I'M AN IDIOT.

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:03.756
OH, MAN!

00:07:03.797 --> 00:07:06.175
( GROANS )
REALLY PISSES ME OFF.

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:08.927
WHAT'S THAT LOOK FOR?

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:11.263
Kyoji: NOTHING.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THAT,

00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:13.223
LIKE, YOU'RE ACTING
KIND OF STRANGE.

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:15.851
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE
EVER TALKED THIS MUCH

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:16.977
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE BEFORE.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:18.937
Shino: YOU'RE KIDDING. REALLY?

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:22.941
Kyoji: YEAH. I MEAN, YOU DON'T
USUALLY LET PEOPLE GET TO YOU,

00:07:22.983 --> 00:07:24.568
YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.905
Shino: I GET LIKE THIS
WHEN PEOPLE PUSH MY BUTTONS.

00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:29.948
Kyoji: YEAH, I GUESS YOU DO.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.575
I KNOW.

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.078
HOW 'BOUT WE FIND A FIELD
IN THE GAME AND AMBUSH HIM?

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:35.079
Shino: HUH?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.538
Kyoji: YEAH. I CAN LURE HIM OUT,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.790
AND THEN YOU CAN SNIPE HIM.

00:07:37.831 --> 00:07:39.750
ALTHOUGH, IF YOU WANT
TO GET HIM BACK,

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.335
YOU PROBABLY WANT
TO TAKE HIM HEAD‐ON.

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:42.920
EITHER WAY, I KNOW I CAN FIND

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:46.298
A COUPLE MACHINE GUNNERS
TO BACK YOU UP IF YOU WANT.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.883
Shino: THANK YOU, BUT MM‐MM.

00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:50.052
I HAD SOMETHING ELSE IN MIND.

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.930
IT'S LIKE, YEAH,
HE PISSES ME OFF,

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:56.600
BUT WHEN HE FIGHTS, AT LEAST
HE SEEMS HONORABLE ABOUT IT.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.727
UNLESS I BEAT HIM
FAIR AND SQUARE,

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.270
IT WON'T MEAN ANYTHING.

00:08:00.312 --> 00:08:02.731
AND IN TODAY'S FINAL,
I'M GONNA BLOW A HOLE

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:06.235
THROUGH THAT DUMB AVATAR OF HIS
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO.

00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:08.570
Kirito: WOULD YOU MIND
SURRENDERING, THEN?

00:08:08.612 --> 00:08:11.240
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF SLASHING AT GIRLS.

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:13.659
Shino: ( GROANS )

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.993
( GASPS )

00:08:15.035 --> 00:08:17.579
JUST YOU WAIT.

00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:20.791
I SWEAR I'M GONNA PAY YOU BACK
DOUBLE FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

00:08:25.587 --> 00:08:27.047
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:29.216
Kyoji: NOTHING.
IT'S JUST THAT...

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:30.467
YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:31.510
Shino: HUH?

00:08:33.762 --> 00:08:35.639
WOW. I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:39.309
I GUESS IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME,
'CAUSE I WAS SO MAD.

00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:40.811
Kyoji: OH.

00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:44.565
ASADA...

00:08:44.606 --> 00:08:47.443
Shino: ( GASPS )
W‐WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:08:47.484 --> 00:08:49.027
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:08:49.069 --> 00:08:51.447
Kyoji: I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
THAT'S WHAT.

00:08:51.488 --> 00:08:54.700
YOU'RE NOT ACTING
LIKE YOUR USUAL SELF TODAY.

00:08:54.742 --> 00:08:55.701
Shino: OH.

00:08:56.994 --> 00:09:00.789
W‐WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HOW DO I USUALLY ACT?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.251
Kyoji: AS LONG
AS I'VE KNOWN YOU,

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:06.128
YOU'VE BEEN COOL,
CALM, AND LEVELHEADED.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.546
NOTHING GETS TO YOU.

00:09:07.588 --> 00:09:10.549
YOU'VE GOT THE SAME PROBLEMS
AT SCHOOL AS ME,

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:13.218
BUT YOU DIDN'T RUN AWAY
LIKE I DID.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.304
YOU'RE, LIKE, REALLY STRONG.

00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:18.390
Shino: BUT I‐I'M
NOT STRONG AT ALL.

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:19.641
YOU KNOW THAT.

00:09:19.683 --> 00:09:22.644
I GET FREAKED OUT
WHENEVER I SEE A GUN.

00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:24.229
Kyoji: BUT SINON DOESN'T.

00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:27.900
SHE'S GOT THAT AMAZING RIFLE
AND KNOWS HOW TO USE IT.

00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:31.403
IF YOU ASK ME,
THAT'S WHO YOU REALLY ARE,

00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:33.071
AND I KNOW, ONE DAY,

00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:35.741
YOU'LL BE LIKE THAT
IN REAL LIFE, TOO.

00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:39.328
THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU
GO BALLISTIC OVER THAT GUY,

00:09:39.369 --> 00:09:41.413
I START TO WORRY.

00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:43.832
WHEN I SEE YOU
LOSE IT LIKE THAT,

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.417

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:48.128
I'D DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOU!

00:09:49.129 --> 00:09:50.589

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:53.550
I USED TO BE NORMAL ONCE.

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:57.387
I LAUGHED AND CRIED
JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE.

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:03.685

BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

I'M SORRY.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:22.579

I'M JUST NOT READY TO BE

00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:35.759
BESIDES, I CAN'T REALLY
FIX WHAT'S BOTHERING ME

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.845
UNLESS I DO IT ON MY OWN.

00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:40.055

00:10:41.056 --> 00:10:42.140

YOU COULD WAIT FOR ME?

TELL ME WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU.

Kazuto: I'VE GOT
A PERSONAL QUESTION,

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:30.542
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER,
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:33.420
OF ALL THE PATIENTS
YOU'VE CARED FOR,

00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:35.797
CAN YOU REMEMBER
THE ONES WHO DIED?

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.591
Aki: LET'S SEE.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.843
I GUESS IF I THINK ABOUT IT,

00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:42.387
I CAN RECALL
THEIR FACES AND NAMES,

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:47.350
EVEN PATIENTS I ONLY SPENT
AN HOUR OR SO WITH IN THE O.R.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.394
MM‐HMM. I REMEMBER.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:51.646
Kazuto: DO YOU EVER WISH

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.398
YOU COULD JUST FORGET
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.901
Aki: HMM. THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:13:00.113
NOT SURE IF THIS IS AN ANSWER,
BUT IT'S THE BEST I GOT.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:03.450
I GUESS I THINK IF SOMETHING'S
MEANT TO BE FORGOTTEN,

00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:05.827
A PERSON'LL END UP FORGETTING IT

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:08.622
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING
THEY WANT TO.

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.123
THAT SAID,

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:13.126
THE MORE A PERSON WISHES
THEY COULD FORGET SOMETHING,

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:15.003
THE STRONGER THE MEMORY BECOMES,

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.339
TILL THEY CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.257
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:22.344
THEN MAYBE SUBCONSCIOUSLY,
WHATEVER THE MEMORY IS,

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:24.763
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT SHOULDN'T BE FORGOTTEN.

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.682
Kazuto: THEN IF I FORGOT,

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.393
I MUST BE A MONSTER.

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:35.065
WHEN I WAS STUCK IN S.A.O.,

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.233
I TOOK OUT‐‐

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:39.444
NO, I KILLED THREE PEOPLE.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.322
THEY WERE ALL RED PLAYERS,

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.449
SO MURDER WAS THEIR BUSINESS,

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.409
AND I COULD HAVE
OVERPOWERED THEM

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.328
INSTEAD OF KILLING THEM, BUT...

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.456
I WENT AHEAD
AND KILLED THEM ANYWAY.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:55.293
I DID IT OUT OF RAGE,
HATRED, REVENGE.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.672
AND OVER THE PAST YEAR,

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:01.383
I'VE TOTALLY FORGOTTEN
ALL ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.718
EVEN AS I SIT HERE
TALKING ABOUT IT,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.721
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT TWO OF 'EM LOOKED LIKE

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.390
OR WHAT THEIR NAMES WERE.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.641
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.102
IF I CAN FORGET PEOPLE I KILLED,

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:15.272
WHAT'S THAT SAY
ABOUT ME AS A PERSON?

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.988
Aki: I'M SORRY, KIRIGAYA.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.449
I GUESS I'M NOT THE AWESOME
COUNSELOR I THOUGHT I WAS.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:29.661
I WISH I COULD TAKE AWAY
THE BURDEN YOU'RE CARRYING

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:32.622
OR AT LEAST HELP
SHARE THE LOAD OF IT.

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:35.458
WHAT DO I KNOW?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.003
I'VE NEVER EVEN PLAYED
SWORD ART ONLINE.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.922
WHEN YOU SAY YOU KILLED SOMEONE,

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:43.174
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.176
BUT THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.720
WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE,

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.930
THE REASON YOU DID WHAT YOU DID

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:52.017
WAS TO SAVE SOMEONE ELSE,
WASN'T IT?

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.935
IN THE MEDICAL FIELD,

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.771
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO CHOOSE
WHO TO SAVE.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:00.442
IT DOESN'T MAKE THE DECISION
TO LET SOMEONE DIE ANY EASIER,

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:03.194
BUT STILL,
IN A LIFE‐OR‐DEATH SITUATION,

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.654
EVERYONE'S GOT THE RIGHT

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:06.990
TO CONSIDER THE PEOPLE
THEY CAN SAVE

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:09.200
OVER THOSE THEY CAN'T,

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:10.744
EVEN YOU.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:14.039
JUST THINK ABOUT THE LIVES
OF ALL THE PEOPLE YOU SAVED,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.207
AND YOU'LL MAKE PEACE
WITH YOUR DECISION.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.376
Kazuto: I DON'T KNOW.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:21.171
I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU, BUT...

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.757
I CAN'T. I KILLED PEOPLE.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.676
I KILLED 'EM, AND I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHO THEY WERE!

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:28.345
DON'T YOU GET IT?

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.764
IT'S LIKE I DON'T EVEN CARE
THAT THEY'RE DEAD.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:33.141
I DON'T DESERVE
TO FIND ANY PEACE!

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:39.022
Aki: IF YOU DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID,

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:41.149
YOU WOULDN'T BE
SUFFERING LIKE THIS.

AND WHEN THE TIME'S RIGHT,

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.165
IT'LL ALL COME BACK TO YOU.

00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:00.168
WHEN IT DOES‐‐AND IT WILL‐‐

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.920
JUST MAKE SURE YOU REMEMBER
