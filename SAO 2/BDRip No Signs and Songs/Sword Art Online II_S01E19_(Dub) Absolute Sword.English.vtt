WEBVTT

00:00:04.177 --> 00:00:06.679
Asuna: SO ZEKKEN
SHOWS UP AT 3:00

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.599
‐ ON THIS ISLAND ON FLOOR 24.
‐ Lisbeth: MM‐HMM.

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:11.601
Asuna: THEN I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
THERE TOMORROW AT 2:30.

00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:12.810
‐ Leafa: OKAY.
‐ Lisbeth: YOU GOT IT.

00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:13.811
Silica: I CAN'T WAIT.

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:15.355
THIS'LL BE SO MUCH FUN.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:17.524
‐ Leafa: YEAH, IT WILL.
‐ Lisbeth: HUH. YEAH!

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.442
THE BERSERK HEALER'S
GONNA GET UNLEASHED.

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:20.777
Asuna: OH?

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:23.905
Yui: DADDY, YOU HAVE
SOMETHING ON YOUR FACE.

00:00:23.947 --> 00:00:25.240
Kirito: HUH? FOR REAL?

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:27.242
Yui: YES. IT'S COVERED IN INK.

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:29.202
‐ Kirito: YOU'RE KIDDING!
‐ Yui: (LAUGHS)

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:30.662
Asuna: SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW.

00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:32.705
‐ Lisbeth: YEAH! SEE YA!
‐ Silica: SEE YA!

00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:58.814
Asuna: (SHIVERS)

00:01:07.073 --> 00:01:08.407
(DOOR BEEPS)

00:01:13.287 --> 00:01:15.289
(SIGHS)

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.308
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:02.981
(FOOTSTEP)

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:06.694
GOOD NIGHT, MS. SADA.

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:08.487
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.156
I'M SORRY
YOU HAD TO WORK SO LATE.

00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:14.493
Sada: (SIGHS)
NOT AT ALL, REALLY.

00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:16.620
JUST DOING MY JOB, MISS.

00:03:18.247 --> 00:03:21.041
Asuna: DO YOU KNOW IF MY MOTHER
AND BROTHER ARE HOME YET?

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:22.418
Sada: KOICHIRO PHONED TO SAY

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.378
HE WON'T BE IN
TILL LATE TONIGHT,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.047
AND YOUR MOTHER
IS WAITING IN THE DINING ROOM.

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.341
Asuna: OH. THANK YOU.

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:31.427
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, MS. SADA.

00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:38.809
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:03:55.617 --> 00:03:56.910
Kyoko: YOU'RE LATE.

00:03:56.952 --> 00:03:59.663
(CLOCK CHIMING)

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:06.086
NEXT TIME, I WANT YOU HERE
FIVE MINUTES EARLY

00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:07.921
Asuna: YES, MA'AM.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.592
(CHAIR CLATTERING)

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:24.396
(GASPS)

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:27.107
IT LOOKS GOOD.

00:04:45.793 --> 00:04:48.253
Kyoko: I ASSUME YOU WERE
USING THAT THING AGAIN?

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:49.713
Asuna: YES.

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:52.591
MY FRIENDS AND I WERE
DOING OUR HOMEWORK TOGETHER.

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:55.928
UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY
PHYSICALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK,

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:57.596
YOU WON'T LEARN A THING.

00:04:57.638 --> 00:05:00.432
Asuna: BUT WE ALL LIVE
SO FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

00:05:00.474 --> 00:05:02.518
IT'S MORE CONVENIENT
FOR US TO MEET IN‐GAME.

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.353
Kyoko: IT HARDLY
QUALIFIES AS MEETING

00:05:04.394 --> 00:05:05.896
IF YOU'RE USING THAT TOY.

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.690
BESIDES, DOING YOUR HOMEWORK
IS NOT A TEAM ACTIVITY.

00:05:08.732 --> 00:05:11.401
IF YOU'RE WITH YOUR FRIENDS,
YOU'LL JUST FOOL AROUND.

00:05:13.737 --> 00:05:17.366
ASUNA, YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY AROUND ANYMORE.

00:05:17.407 --> 00:05:19.451
YOU'RE TWO YEARS
BEHIND EVERYONE ELSE.

00:05:19.493 --> 00:05:21.912
YOU SHOULD BE STUDYING
AS HARD AS YOU CAN

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:24.164
TO MAKE UP
FOR ALL THAT LOST TIME.

00:05:24.206 --> 00:05:25.958
Asuna: BUT I AM STUDYING HARD.

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.877
DIDN'T YOU SEE MY GRADES
FOR THE SECOND SEMESTER?

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.587
I LEFT THEM ON YOUR DESK.

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.172
Kyoko: YES, I SAW THEM,

00:05:32.214 --> 00:05:36.176
BUT GRADES FROM A SCHOOL
LIKE THAT ARE SUSPECT, AT BEST.

00:05:36.218 --> 00:05:38.136
Asuna: THEY'RE NOT SUSPECT.

00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:41.056
Kyoko: YES, WELL,
FOR YOUR NEXT TRIMESTER,

00:05:41.098 --> 00:05:43.392
I'VE DECIDED
TO HIRE YOU A TUTOR,

00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:46.353
AND NOT ONE OF THOSE VIRTUAL
ONES EVERYONE'S GOING ON ABOUT,

00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:47.938
SOMEONE WHO'LL COME
TO THE HOUSE.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.774
Asuna: BUT DON'T I GET
TO HAVE ANY SAY IN IT?

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:52.818
Kyoko: HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.616
Asuna: A TRANSFER EXAM
STUDY GUIDE?

00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:02.578
Kyoko: I KNOW SOMEONE
ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THERE.

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:03.829
AFTER SOME DISCUSSION,

00:06:03.871 --> 00:06:05.998
I CONVINCED THEM
TO LET YOU TAKE AN EXAM

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:07.708
TO TRANSFER
INTO THEIR SENIOR CLASS.

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:12.170
IT'S A PROPER HIGH SCHOOL,
NOT SOME MAKESHIFT STUDY HALL.

00:06:12.212 --> 00:06:13.505
AND SINCE IT'S CREDIT‐BASED,

00:06:13.547 --> 00:06:15.841
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
ABLE TO GRADUATE

00:06:15.883 --> 00:06:17.342
AFTER THE FIRST TRIMESTER.

00:06:17.384 --> 00:06:20.220
IF YOU DO, YOU'LL BE
BACK ON TRACK FOR COLLEGE.

00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:21.805
Asuna: WAIT! HOLD ON!

00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:24.182
YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE A DECISION
LIKE THIS WITHOUT ME!

00:06:24.224 --> 00:06:26.602
I‐I HAPPEN TO LIKE
THE SCHOOL I'M IN.

00:06:26.643 --> 00:06:28.103
THE TEACHERS THERE ARE GREAT.

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:30.814
I‐I CAN LEARN THERE
JUST AS MUCH AS ANYWHERE!

00:06:30.856 --> 00:06:32.524
I DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE SCHOOLS!

00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:34.484
Kyoko: (SIGHS)

00:06:35.986 --> 00:06:39.531
I'VE DONE MY RESEARCH,
YOU KNOW, AND BELIEVE ME,

00:06:39.573 --> 00:06:42.868
THAT PLACE YOU'RE ATTENDING
CAN HARDLY BE CALLED A SCHOOL.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.288
THE CURRICULUM IS SLAPDASH,
AND THE CLASSES ARE A JOKE.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.165
EVEN THE FACULTY'S SUBSTANDARD.

00:06:48.206 --> 00:06:49.833
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF LOSERS

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:51.710
WITH NO REAL CREDENTIALS
TO SPEAK OF.

00:06:51.752 --> 00:06:52.836
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:06:52.878 --> 00:06:54.671
DON'T SAY THAT.

00:06:58.216 --> 00:07:00.135
Kyoko: THEY CLAIM
THEY'RE HELPING THE STUDENTS

00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:02.137
WHO FELL BEHIND
BECAUSE OF THAT ACCIDENT.

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:05.057
IT'S ALL A LIE.
THEY JUST WANT ALL THE CHILDREN

00:07:05.098 --> 00:07:07.684
WHO'VE SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS
KILLING EACH OTHER

00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:10.437
IN ONE CONVENIENT PLACE
SO THEY CAN MONITOR THEM.

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.939
IT'S MORE LIKE AN ASYLUM
THAN A SCHOOL.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.152
Asuna: DID YOU FORGET, MOTHER?

00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:19.905
I SPENT TWO YEARS
KILLING OTHER KIDS, TOO.

00:07:20.906 --> 00:07:22.574
(GASPS)

00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:25.327
Kyoko: ALL THE FRIENDS
YOU HAD BACK IN JUNIOR HIGH

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:27.663
ARE STUDYING TO GET
INTO COLLEGE THIS YEAR.

00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:29.039
THEY'RE LEAVING YOU BEHIND.

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.957
DOESN'T THAT BOTHER YOU?

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:33.669
Asuna: NOT AT ALL. IF IT TAKES
AN EXTRA YEAR OR TWO,

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.171
IT WON'T MAKE MUCH
OF A DIFFERENCE.

00:07:36.213 --> 00:07:39.091
BESIDES, I MIGHT NOT WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

00:07:39.132 --> 00:07:41.385
Kyoko: RIDICULOUS.
I WON'T ENTERTAIN SUCH TALK.

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:44.304
YOU'RE FAR TOO GIFTED,
AND YOUR FATHER AND I

00:07:44.346 --> 00:07:46.807
HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS
TO NURTURE YOUR TALENTS.

00:07:46.848 --> 00:07:48.684
I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THAT.

00:07:48.725 --> 00:07:51.978
Asuna: I DO, BUT SHOULDN'T I GET
TO HAVE A SAY IN MY OWN FUTURE?

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.898
SURE, I MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT KIND
OF CAREER I WANT RIGHT NOW,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.274
BUT I'M CLOSE TO FINDING OUT.

00:07:56.316 --> 00:07:58.860
IF I STAY IN MY SCHOOL
FOR ANOTHER YEAR,

00:07:58.902 --> 00:08:00.862
IT WILL HELP ME MAKE
THAT DECISION.

00:08:00.904 --> 00:08:02.364
Kyoko: (SIGHS)

00:08:02.406 --> 00:08:05.492
NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU STAY
AT A PLACE LIKE THAT,

00:08:05.534 --> 00:08:06.952
IT'LL JUST LIMIT YOUR OPTIONS.

00:08:06.993 --> 00:08:08.286
LOOK, TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

00:08:08.328 --> 00:08:10.831
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE A WRONG TURN NOW

00:08:10.872 --> 00:08:11.998
AND REGRET IT LATER.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.084
I JUST WANT YOU
TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:16.795
AND FIND YOURSELF A GOOD CAREER
YOU CAN BE PROUD OF.

00:08:16.837 --> 00:08:20.424
Asuna: SO THAT BOY YOU FORCED ME
TO MEET ON NEW YEAR'S DAY,

00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:23.009
THAT WAS YOU TRYING
TO HELP ME WITH MY CAREER?

00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:24.636
YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD HIM.

00:08:24.678 --> 00:08:26.972
HE WAS TALKING LIKE WE WERE
ALREADY ENGAGED OR SOMETHING.

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:29.391
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S LIMITING MY OPTIONS,

00:08:29.433 --> 00:08:31.435
NOT ME AND NOT MY SCHOOL!

00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:37.399
MARRIAGE IS PART OF YOUR CAREER.

00:08:38.608 --> 00:08:40.944
IF YOU MARRY BENEATH YOU
OR MARRY POOR,

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:42.404
I GUARANTEE YOU'LL REGRET IT.

00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:44.531
YOU WON'T HAVE
THE MEANS TO PURSUE

00:08:44.573 --> 00:08:46.366
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU REALLY WANT TO DO.

00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:50.370
THAT'S WHY I THINK YUUYA
WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.

00:08:50.412 --> 00:08:52.706
HIS FAMILY OWNS
A SMALL REGIONAL BANK.

00:08:52.748 --> 00:08:54.124
THOSE ARE MUCH MORE STABLE

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:57.335
THAN SOME MEGA‐BANK
RUN BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

00:09:00.338 --> 00:09:03.008
Asuna: YOUR LAST CHOICE
WASN'T VERY GOOD.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.177
DID YOU FORGET HOW HE MADE ME

00:09:05.218 --> 00:09:07.095
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY OTHERS SUFFER?

00:09:07.137 --> 00:09:10.724
NOBUYUKI SUGOU
NEARLY BANKRUPTED RECT.

00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:12.768
HE WAS YOUR CHOICE, MOTHER.

00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:14.311
Kyoko: ENOUGH, YOUNG LADY!

00:09:14.352 --> 00:09:17.147
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT HIM IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.483
AND YOU'RE WRONG.
IT WASN'T MY CHOICE.

00:09:19.524 --> 00:09:20.942
IT WAS YOUR FATHER'S.

00:09:20.984 --> 00:09:23.445
HE SUGGESTED THAT CROOK
MARRY INTO THIS FAMILY.

00:09:23.487 --> 00:09:25.947
HE'S NEVER BEEN
A GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

00:09:25.989 --> 00:09:27.365
BUT DON'T WORRY.

00:09:27.407 --> 00:09:29.826
YUUYA MIGHT LACK INITIATIVE,
BUT HE SEEMS STABLE,

00:09:29.868 --> 00:09:32.537
AND STABILITY IS
THE CORNERSTONE OF MARRIAGE.

00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:33.872
Asuna: I DON'T CARE.

00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:36.041
I HAVE NO INTENTION
TO DATE OR MARRY HIM.

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:37.626
I CHOOSE WHO I'LL MARRY.

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:40.504
Kyoko: FINE.
AS LONG AS THE MAN YOU CHOOSE

00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:43.465
IS FROM A GOOD FAMILY
AND IS WORTHY OF YOU.

00:09:43.507 --> 00:09:45.300
HOWEVER, A BOY LIKE THAT,

00:09:45.342 --> 00:09:48.512
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND FROM SCHOOL,
IS NOT WORTHY.

00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:50.972
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:09:51.014 --> 00:09:54.559
Y‐YOU HAD HIM INVESTIGATED?

00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:57.020
Kyoko: OF COURSE I DID.
TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

00:09:57.062 --> 00:09:59.815
YOUR FATHER AND I ONLY WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU IN LIFE.

00:09:59.856 --> 00:10:02.400
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL
TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT

00:10:02.442 --> 00:10:04.778
AS LONG AS YOU MAKE
THE RIGHT CHOICES.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.828
Asuna: I NEED TIME
TO THINK ABOUT TRANSFERRING.

00:10:12.869 --> 00:10:15.288
Kyoko: KEEP IN MIND
THE DEADLINE'S NEXT WEEK.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.748
DON'T FORGET.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.459
AND AFTER YOU FILL OUT THE FORM,
MAKE THREE COPIES,

00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:22.003
AND LEAVE THEM
IN MY OFFICE ON MY DESK.

00:10:23.505 --> 00:10:24.464
Asuna: MOTHER...

00:10:24.506 --> 00:10:26.424
Kyoko: WHAT IS IT?

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:28.635
Asuna: EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE GONE,

00:10:28.677 --> 00:10:31.847
YOU'RE STILL ASHAMED OF GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA, AREN'T YOU?

00:10:31.888 --> 00:10:35.183
YOU'RE ANGRY YOU WEREN'T BORN
INTO A RICH, IMPORTANT FAMILY.

00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:37.185
Kyoko: (GASPS)

00:10:37.227 --> 00:10:39.938
ASUNA, COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.148
ASUNA!

00:10:47.737 --> 00:10:49.906
(ASUNA FLOPS DOWN)

00:10:56.954 --> 00:10:58.289
Asuna: KIRITO.

00:11:00.249 --> 00:11:02.502
HEY, ABOUT THAT QUESTIONNAIRE,

00:11:02.543 --> 00:11:04.420
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHAT YOU WANNA DO YET?

00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:06.506
Kazuto: I GUESS, IF ANYTHING,

00:11:06.547 --> 00:11:08.925
I WANNA GO FROM PLAYING GAMES
TO BEING A CREATOR.

00:11:08.966 --> 00:11:11.803
Asuna: A CREATOR?
WHAT, FOR GAMES?

00:11:11.844 --> 00:11:13.346
Kazuto: NO, NOT FOR GAMES.

00:11:13.388 --> 00:11:15.264
I WANNA MAKE
A HUMAN‐MACHINE INTERFACE

00:11:15.306 --> 00:11:17.141
TO REPLACE
THE FULL‐DIVE TECH WE USE NOW.

00:11:17.183 --> 00:11:19.060
I'VE BEEN GOING
TO ALL THESE TECH FORUMS

00:11:19.102 --> 00:11:20.645
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT,

00:11:20.687 --> 00:11:23.648
BUT IT'S A HECK OF A LOT
OF INFORMATION TO ABSORB.

00:11:25.358 --> 00:11:29.654
Asuna: I WANT TO BE WITH KIRITO
AND GO AFTER THE SAME DREAM,

00:11:29.696 --> 00:11:30.697
BUT NOW...

00:11:31.739 --> 00:11:33.616
Kirito: YOU SURE ARE STRONG,

00:11:33.658 --> 00:11:35.702
WAY STRONGER THAN I AM.

00:11:35.743 --> 00:11:38.413
Asuna: I'M NOT STRONG AT ALL.

00:11:38.454 --> 00:11:39.872
(SOBS)

00:11:39.914 --> 00:11:42.041
IN THAT WORLD, I WAS A WARRIOR,

00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:43.459
BUT HERE...

00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:46.462
LIGHTNING FLASH ASUNA

00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:49.882
OF THE KNIGHTS
OF THE BLOOD OATH IS GONE.

00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:56.431
IN THE REAL WORLD,
I DON'T HAVE ANY REAL POWER.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.114
Kirito: HEY.

00:12:11.156 --> 00:12:15.076
Asuna: IT'S RARE FOR YOU TO BE
SO PUNCTUAL, DON'T YA THINK?

00:12:15.118 --> 00:12:16.536
Kirito: IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:20.999
Asuna: (SIGHS)

00:12:24.002 --> 00:12:26.421
Yui: (SNORING)

00:12:29.382 --> 00:12:30.550
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:12:31.634 --> 00:12:32.886
(SIGHS)

00:12:43.354 --> 00:12:44.856
HEY, YOU REMEMBER?

00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:47.650
YOU KNOW, THAT ONE DAY YOU
CAME TO MY PLACE IN SELMBURG

00:12:47.692 --> 00:12:48.818
AND I MADE YOU DINNER?

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.320
Kirito: HATE TO SAY IT,

00:12:50.361 --> 00:12:52.530
BUT MY MEMORY'S ABOUT AS GOOD
AS MY PUNCTUALITY.

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:54.199
Asuna: WHAT?!

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.535
Kirito: YEAH. I REMEMBER
THAT DAY LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

00:12:57.577 --> 00:12:58.620
Asuna: REALLY?

00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:00.413
Kirito: OF COURSE. LET'S SEE.

00:13:00.455 --> 00:13:03.625
THAT'S THE DAY I GOT
A SUPER‐RARE FOOD ITEM, RIGHT?

00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:06.085
AND YOU MADE
AN AWESOME STEW OUT OF IT.

00:13:06.127 --> 00:13:08.713
(SIGHS)
THAT WAS SOME TASTY MEAT.

00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:10.715
I'M NEVER GONNA FORGET THAT DAY.

00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:12.217
Asuna: (GROANS)

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:13.551
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING

00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:15.220
EXCEPT THAT STUPID DINNER?!

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:16.763
Kirito: (LAUGHS)

00:13:16.805 --> 00:13:18.431
Asuna: (LAUGHS)

00:13:20.183 --> 00:13:22.185
IT'S ALMOST TIME.

00:13:22.227 --> 00:13:23.728
I BETTER GET OVER THERE.

00:13:25.396 --> 00:13:27.690
Kirito: ASUNA,
BE CAREFUL WITH ZEKKEN.

00:13:27.732 --> 00:13:28.775
Asuna: HUH?

00:13:28.817 --> 00:13:30.527
Kirito: WELL, IT'S LIKE‐‐

00:13:30.568 --> 00:13:33.530
ZEKKEN'S REALLY STRONG.
JUST SAYIN'.

00:13:33.571 --> 00:13:34.906
Asuna: DON'T YOU WORRY.

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:36.950
LIZ AND THE OTHERS
ALREADY TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:38.243
(LAUGHS)

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:40.578
YUP, THEY EVEN TOLD ME
ABOUT HOW YOU LOST.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.038
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.498
OH, BY THE WAY,

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.125
LEAFA SAID IN THE MIDDLE
OF YOUR DUEL WITH ZEKKEN,

00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:47.627
YOU STOPPED FIGHTING TO TALK.

00:13:47.669 --> 00:13:48.962
WHAT'D YOU TALK ABOUT?

00:13:49.003 --> 00:13:51.923
Kirito: WELL, ACTUALLY,
I ASKED A QUESTION.

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:52.966
Asuna: WHAT ABOUT?

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.971
Kirito: I GOT A WEIRD VIBE,
SO I ASKED...

00:13:58.012 --> 00:14:01.057
YOU'RE FULL‐TIME IN THIS WORLD,
AREN'T YOU, ZEKKEN?

00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:03.726
AND THEN, FOR AN ANSWER,

00:14:03.768 --> 00:14:06.354
I GOT A SLY GRIN
AND A MEGA‐FAST ATTACK.

00:14:06.396 --> 00:14:10.233
I'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
MOVE THAT FAST.

00:14:10.275 --> 00:14:13.570
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY
"FULL TIME IN THIS WORLD"?

00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:16.948
IS THAT THE SAME THING
AS BEING A HEAVY USER?

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.992
Kirito: UH‐UH.
ZEKKEN'S WAY DIFFERENT

00:14:19.033 --> 00:14:21.119
THAN YOUR AVERAGE,
EVERYDAY HARDCORE GAMER.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.414
IT FELT LIKE‐‐LIKE THEY
WERE A SORT OF PRODUCT

00:14:24.414 --> 00:14:26.791
OF THE FULL‐DIVE
ENVIRONMENT ITSELF.

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:29.711
Asuna: I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:14:29.752 --> 00:14:32.505
Kirito: IN A WAY,
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER YOU DON'T.

00:14:32.547 --> 00:14:36.342
THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT
IS FOR YOU TO EXPERIENCE IT.

00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:40.638
Lisbeth: (COUGHS)

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.307
EVERY TIME WE TURN AROUND,

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:44.267
YOU'RE ALWAYS
PAWIN' AT EACH OTHER.

00:14:47.145 --> 00:14:48.855
SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR LITTLE LOVE‐FEST,

00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:51.232

Asuna: YOU DIDN'T SAY
ZEKKEN'S A GIRL!

00:15:54.964 --> 00:15:57.300
Lisbeth: I DIDN'T?
I COULD'VE SWORN I DID.

00:15:57.342 --> 00:15:58.802

‐ AND YOU‐‐
‐ Kirito: (GASPS)

00:16:01.304 --> 00:16:04.265
Asuna: I HAVE A FEELING
I KNOW WHY YOU LOST NOW.

00:16:04.307 --> 00:16:06.309
STARE...

00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:08.978
Kirito: MM‐MM.
NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.065
I DIDN'T GO EASY ON HER
'CAUSE SHE'S A GIRL!

00:16:12.107 --> 00:16:14.150
I WAS GOIN' FULL‐OUT! I SWEAR!

WANNA TAKE ME ON TODAY?

00:16:24.244 --> 00:16:26.204
Lisbeth: YOU'RE UP.
GO ON. GET 'ER!

Asuna: WAIT. I GOTTA
PSYCH MYSELF UP FIRST.

Lisbeth: OH, PLEASE!
ONCE YOU CROSS SWORDS WITH HER,

00:16:30.542 --> 00:16:31.835

OH, WAIT. ALMOST FORGOT.

00:17:10.695 --> 00:17:13.656
YOU WANNA FIGHT ON THE GROUND
OR IN THE AIR?

LET'S DUEL ON THE GROUND, THEN.
