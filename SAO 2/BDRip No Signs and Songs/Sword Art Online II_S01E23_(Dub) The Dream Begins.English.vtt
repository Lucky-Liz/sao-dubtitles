IF YOU WANT TO PRIORITIZE
THE VISUAL TRACKING,

YOU GOTTA GIVE YOURSELF

00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:13.811
A LITTLE MORE ROOM
IN THESE PARAMETERS.

IF SHE MAKES
ANY SUDDEN MOVES?

JUST HAVE TO TRUST

WHICH DREW HIM.

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:07.765
WHEN YOU TURN SIXTEEN,

00:09:07.807 --> 00:09:09.559
FIND SOMEONE YOU LOVE,
AND MARRY 'EM!

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.060
THAT WAY,
YOU'LL HAVE SOMEONE AROUND

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:13.479
WHO'LL KEEP THIS HOUSE
FROM EVER BEING TORN DOWN.

00:09:13.521 --> 00:09:15.481
Yuuki: (LAUGHS)

00:09:15.523 --> 00:09:17.650
YOU GOT THE CRAZIEST IDEAS!

00:09:17.692 --> 00:09:19.277
(SIGHS)

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:21.946
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE
I WANNA MARRY, THOUGH.

00:09:21.988 --> 00:09:25.157
Asuna: OH, YEAH? BUT YOU AND JUN
MAKE A CUTE COUPLE.

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:27.159
Yuuki: GOD, NO!
THAT GUY'S SO IMMATURE.

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:28.452
Asuna: (LAUGHS)

00:09:28.494 --> 00:09:31.872
Yuuki: LET'S SEE.
WHO SHOULD I MARRY?

00:09:31.914 --> 00:09:33.165
OH, I KNOW!

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:34.458
‐ YOU!
‐ Asuna: HUH?

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:36.335
Yuuki: THE ONLY THING IS,
IF YOU MARRY ME,

00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:37.962
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE THE WIFE.

00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:39.547
I MEAN, THE OTHER WAY AROUND,

00:09:39.589 --> 00:09:41.882
MY NAME'D BE YUUKI YUUKI,
AND THAT'D BE WEIRD.

00:09:41.924 --> 00:09:43.342
(LAUGHS)

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:45.928
Asuna: I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT MY MOM WOULD SAY.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.388
Yuuki: I KNOW. I'M KIDDING.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.182
'SIDES, YOU ALREADY
GOT SOMEONE LINED UP.

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:52.852
Asuna: OH, WELL, YEAH. I GUESS.

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:54.854
Yuuki: STILL,
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.

00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:56.230
I GET THE FEELING

00:09:56.272 --> 00:09:58.274
HE'S NOT LIVING
IN THE REAL WORLD, EITHER.

00:09:58.316 --> 00:09:59.817
NOT LIKE ME, BUT YOU KNOW.

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:01.527
Asuna: (CHUCKLES)

00:10:01.569 --> 00:10:03.779
Yuuki: I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH, ASUNA.

00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:06.115
JUST TO SEE MY OLD HOUSE AGAIN,

00:10:06.157 --> 00:10:08.743
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW HAPPY THAT MAKES ME.

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:10.828
BACK WHEN WE LIVED HERE,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.165
I REMEMBER WE'D GO TO CHURCH
TO PRAY AND STUFF,

00:10:14.206 --> 00:10:17.585
AND MOM USED TO ALWAYS SAY THIS
TO ME AND MY SISTER,

00:10:17.627 --> 00:10:21.005
"GOD WOULD NEVER PUT US
THROUGH ALL THIS SUFFERING

00:10:21.047 --> 00:10:24.342
IF HE DIDN'T THINK
WE COULD BEAR IT."

00:10:24.383 --> 00:10:28.304
IT DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL
ANY BETTER, THOUGH.

00:10:28.346 --> 00:10:31.307
INSTEAD OF QUOTING THE BIBLE,
WHAT I REALLY WANTED

00:10:31.349 --> 00:10:35.311
WAS FOR MOM TO TALK TO US LIKE‐‐
WELL, LIKE A MOM.

00:10:35.353 --> 00:10:38.397
BUT YOU KNOW, AFTER SEEING
OUR OLD HOUSE AGAIN,

00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:39.940
I THINK I GET IT NOW.

00:10:39.982 --> 00:10:42.109
THE WORDS DIDN'T MATTER.

00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:45.321
IT WAS THE FEELING
BEHIND THOSE WORDS.

00:10:45.363 --> 00:10:49.325
SHE WAS PRAYING FOR ME SO I
WOULDN'T FEEL SORRY FOR MYSELF,

00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:51.911
SO I COULD BE STRONG
'TIL THE END,

00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:53.954
AND NOW I FINALLY GET IT.

00:10:55.414 --> 00:10:57.166
Asuna: I'M THE SAME.

00:10:57.208 --> 00:11:00.753
SEE, I‐‐I HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD
MY MOM, EITHER.

00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:04.924
I CAN'T HEAR WHAT SHE'S
REALLY TRYING TO TELL ME.

00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:07.718
SHE CAN'T SEEM TO HEAR ME.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.763
REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME,
THAT SOMETIMES

00:11:10.805 --> 00:11:13.516
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT
TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS?

00:11:13.557 --> 00:11:16.769
HOW CAN I GET TO BE
STRONG LIKE YOU?

00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:18.187
Yuuki: ME?

00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:21.190
HEH. I'M NOT STRONG. NO WAY.

00:11:21.232 --> 00:11:22.566
Asuna: OH, YES, YOU ARE!

00:11:22.608 --> 00:11:23.693
YOU'RE NOT LIKE ME.

00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:25.319
WHEN YOU STAND UP TO SOMEONE,

00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:27.863
YOU DON'T FLINCH
OR LET THEM INTIMIDATE YOU.

00:11:27.905 --> 00:11:30.074
NOTHING SEEMS
TO SCARE YOU AT ALL.

00:11:30.116 --> 00:11:32.076
IT'S LIKE
SECOND NATURE FOR YOU.

00:11:32.118 --> 00:11:34.161
Yuuki: MM, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

00:11:34.203 --> 00:11:36.831
WHEN I WAS LIVING
IN THE REAL WORLD OR‐‐

00:11:36.872 --> 00:11:38.040
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN‐‐

00:11:38.082 --> 00:11:39.667
MOST OF THE TIME,
I WAS FAKING IT.

00:11:39.709 --> 00:11:40.626
Asuna: HUH?

00:11:40.668 --> 00:11:41.752
Yuuki: IT'S LIKE I THOUGHT

00:11:41.794 --> 00:11:43.587
I HAD TO ACT CHEERFUL,

00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:46.549
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA MAKE
MY MOM AND DAD FEEL SAD FOR ME.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.009
Asuna: YUUKI.

00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:51.637
Yuuki: YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT I THINK IN THE END?

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:53.180
SO WHAT IF I'M JUST ACTING?

00:11:53.222 --> 00:11:55.558
IF I GET TO SPEND
MORE TIME SMILING,

00:11:55.599 --> 00:11:58.519
EVEN IF IT'S FAKE,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? AM I RIGHT?

00:11:58.561 --> 00:12:02.314
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
I GOT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME LEFT,

00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:05.484
AND IT'D BE A SHAME
TO WASTE WHATEVER I DO GOT

00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:07.236
BY MOPING AROUND ALL THE TIME,

00:12:07.278 --> 00:12:10.406
SO NOW I SAY EXACTLY
WHAT I FEEL TO EVERYONE,

00:12:10.448 --> 00:12:13.200
AND IF THEY GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT, WHO CARES?

00:12:13.242 --> 00:12:14.994
AT LEAST I SPOKE MY MIND

00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:17.955
AND MAYBE EVEN
GOT A LITTLE CLOSER TO 'EM.

00:12:17.997 --> 00:12:19.874
Asuna: YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:12:19.915 --> 00:12:21.792
THAT'S THE REASON
WE'RE HERE TODAY,

00:12:21.834 --> 00:12:24.587
WHY WE'RE SO CLOSE
AFTER ONLY A FEW DAYS.

00:12:24.628 --> 00:12:26.005
IT'S ALL 'CAUSE OF YOU.

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:27.757
Yuuki: NOPE,
THAT WASN'T 'CAUSE OF ME.

00:12:27.798 --> 00:12:29.467
Asuna: HUH?

00:12:29.508 --> 00:12:31.677
Yuuki: IT'S 'CAUSE
EVEN AFTER I RAN AWAY FROM YOU,

00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:34.972
YOU TRACKED ME DOWN.

00:12:35.014 --> 00:12:39.101
LOOK, HOW 'BOUT YOU TRY TALKING
TO YOUR MOM LIKE YOU DID TO ME?

00:12:39.143 --> 00:12:41.604
IF YOU TRY
TELLING HER HOW YOU FEEL,

00:12:41.645 --> 00:12:43.564
MAYBE YOU'LL
GET THROUGH TO HER.

00:12:43.606 --> 00:12:44.774
Asuna: (SIGHS)

00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:47.109
Yuuki: DON'T WORRY.
YOU CAN DO IT.

00:12:47.151 --> 00:12:49.779
YOU'RE WAY STRONGER
THAN ME, HONEST!

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.032
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:54.241
YUUKI.

00:12:55.868 --> 00:12:58.204
Yuuki: YOU HIT ME
WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAD.

00:12:58.245 --> 00:13:01.791
THAT'S HOW I KNEW I COULD
TRUST YOU WITH EVERYTHING I HAD.

00:13:01.832 --> 00:13:05.002
IN THE END, IT WORKED OUT
FOR BOTH OF US, DIDN'T IT?

00:13:05.044 --> 00:13:06.378
Asuna: YES, IT DID.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.047
THANK YOU SO MUCH, YUUKI.

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:09.924
Yuuki: (CHUCKLES)

00:13:23.814 --> 00:13:25.107
Asuna: (SIGHS)

00:13:25.149 --> 00:13:27.484
Yuuki: IF YOU TRY
TELLING HER HOW YOU FEEL,

00:13:27.526 --> 00:13:29.153
MAYBE YOU'LL
GET THROUGH TO HER.

00:13:30.654 --> 00:13:33.615
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

00:13:37.244 --> 00:13:39.580
Kyoko: COME IN.

00:13:39.621 --> 00:13:42.541
(TYPING)

00:13:47.838 --> 00:13:49.548
(SIGHS)

00:13:52.092 --> 00:13:53.052
YOU'RE LATE AGAIN.

00:13:53.093 --> 00:13:54.344
Asuna: I'M SORRY.

00:13:54.386 --> 00:13:56.013
Kyoko: WELL, IF YOU'RE HUNGRY,

00:13:56.055 --> 00:13:59.516
YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE DO
WITH WHATEVER'S IN THE FRIDGE.

00:13:59.558 --> 00:14:01.435
OH, AND DON'T FORGET,
THE DEADLINE

00:14:01.477 --> 00:14:03.812
FOR YOUR TRANSFER APPLICATION
IS DUE TOMORROW.

00:14:03.854 --> 00:14:06.148
MAKE SURE
IT'S FILLED OUT BY MORNING.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.483
Asuna: ACTUALLY, ABOUT THAT...

00:14:07.524 --> 00:14:10.235
Kyoko: HM?

00:14:10.277 --> 00:14:12.696
Asuna: WE NEED TO TALK, MOTHER.

00:14:12.738 --> 00:14:14.573
Kyoko: WELL, WHAT IS IT?

00:14:14.615 --> 00:14:16.992
Asuna: I CAN'T
REALLY EXPLAIN IT HERE.

00:14:17.034 --> 00:14:20.329
Kyoko: OKAY, THEN.
WHERE SHALL WE GO?

00:14:22.873 --> 00:14:24.124
Asuna: THE VIRTUAL WORLD.

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:26.168
IT'LL ONLY BE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.045
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO USE THIS.

00:14:30.255 --> 00:14:32.007
Kyoko: DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

00:14:32.049 --> 00:14:35.177
IF YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT LIKE A NORMAL PERSON,

00:14:35.219 --> 00:14:36.595
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

00:14:36.637 --> 00:14:37.763
Asuna: BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:14:37.805 --> 00:14:39.765
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN EXPLAIN!

00:14:39.807 --> 00:14:41.016
IT'S JUST FIVE MINUTES!

00:14:42.392 --> 00:14:43.519
MOM, PLEASE!

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.479
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO TELL YOU

00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:47.648
WHAT I'M THINKING
AND HOW I'M FEELING, HONEST!

00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:49.858
I CAN'T TELL YOU
ANY OF THAT HERE!

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.777
JUST THIS ONCE.

00:14:51.819 --> 00:14:54.571
MOM, ALL I WANT IS
FOR YOU TO SEE MY WORLD!

00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:00.828
Kyoko: (SIGHS)

00:15:00.869 --> 00:15:02.621
FIVE MINUTES.

00:15:02.663 --> 00:15:03.956
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:15:03.997 --> 00:15:06.750
Kyoko: BUT NO MATTER
WHAT YOU SAY,

00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:09.044
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF ALLOWING YOU

00:15:09.086 --> 00:15:11.505
TO ATTEND THAT SCHOOL AGAIN
NEXT YEAR, UNDERSTOOD?

00:15:11.547 --> 00:15:14.842
ALSO ONCE YOU'RE DONE, YOU WILL
FILL OUT THAT APPLICATION.

00:15:14.883 --> 00:15:16.552
Asuna: OKAY.

00:15:16.593 --> 00:15:19.263
Kyoko: SO HOW DO I
USE THAT THING?

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.687
Asuna: JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX.
ONCE I TURN IT ON,

00:15:26.728 --> 00:15:30.023
IT'LL AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT YOU
TO MY SUB‐ACCOUNT IN THE GAME.

00:15:32.151 --> 00:15:34.987
AFTER YOU'RE IN, WAIT FOR ME.

00:15:35.028 --> 00:15:36.989
I'M TURNING IT ON NOW.

00:15:47.249 --> 00:15:48.959
LINK START.

00:16:04.558 --> 00:16:06.685
Kyoko: THIS IS SO BIZARRE.

00:16:06.727 --> 00:16:11.190
SEEING A STRANGE FACE MIMIC
WHAT I DO IS UNSETTLING.

00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:13.734
AND THIS BODY, IT'S SO LIGHT.

00:16:13.775 --> 00:16:15.194
Asuna: OH, THAT'S NORMAL.

00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:17.112
THAT PARTICULAR AVATAR'S
WEIGHT SETTING

00:16:17.154 --> 00:16:19.239
IS ABOUT NINETY POUNDS OR SO.

00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:21.575
FEELS LIGHTER
THAN YOUR REAL BODY, HUH?

00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:23.076
Kyoko: THAT IS SO RUDE!

00:16:23.118 --> 00:16:25.204
I DO NOT APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING.

00:16:25.245 --> 00:16:26.747
THAT'S INTERESTING.

00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:29.750
YOUR FACE HERE
LOOKS JUST LIKE YOUR REAL ONE.

00:16:29.791 --> 00:16:30.751
Asuna: WELL, YES.

00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:32.753
Kyoko: ACTUALLY, I TAKE IT BACK.

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:35.172
YOUR REAL FACE
IS PUFFIER THAN THIS ONE.

00:16:35.214 --> 00:16:36.965
Asuna: OH, NOW WHO'S BEING RUDE?

00:16:37.007 --> 00:16:39.676
I LOOK THE SAME HERE
AS I DO THERE.

00:16:43.096 --> 00:16:45.015
Kyoko: WELL, I'M HERE. NOW WHAT?

00:16:45.057 --> 00:16:46.934
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT.

00:16:46.975 --> 00:16:48.685
Asuna: FOLLOW ME, MOM.

00:17:17.965 --> 00:17:20.717
YOU SEE? IT LOOKS JUST LIKE IT.

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:23.387
Kyoko: I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU MEAN.

00:17:23.428 --> 00:17:26.431
ALL I SEE IS
SOME OLD CEDAR GRO‐‐(GASPS)

00:17:26.473 --> 00:17:28.850
Asuna: DOESN'T IT
BRING BACK MEMORIES

00:17:28.892 --> 00:17:31.562
OF THE HOUSE
THAT GRANDMA AND GRANDPA HAD?

00:17:34.856 --> 00:17:38.860
I REALLY LOVED
THEIR PLACE IN MIYAGI.

00:17:38.902 --> 00:17:40.904
IT WAS MAGICAL.

00:17:50.539 --> 00:17:52.499
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.017
REMEMBER THAT OBON HOLIDAY
WHEN I WAS TWELVE?

00:18:10.058 --> 00:18:11.351
YOU, DAD, AND KOICHIRO

00:18:11.393 --> 00:18:13.854
WENT TO THE YUUKI
FAMILY COMPOUND IN KYOTO,

00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:15.981
AND I WENT TO MIYAGI BY MYSELF.

00:18:16.023 --> 00:18:17.524
Kyoko: I REMEMBER.

00:18:17.566 --> 00:18:19.192
Asuna: WHEN I GOT THERE,

00:18:19.234 --> 00:18:22.894
I APOLOGIZED TO THEM
THAT YOU COULDN'T BE WITH US.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.897
I FELT BAD YOU COULDN'T VISIT
OUR ANCESTORS' GRAVES.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:28.233
Kyoko: I WANTED TO,
BUT THAT YEAR,

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:30.819
THE YUUKIS WERE HAVING
AN IMPORTANT MEMORIAL SERVICE.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.822
Asuna: NO, MOM,
I'M NOT BLAMING YOU OR ANYTHING.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.492
IN FACT, YOU KNOW
WHAT GRANDPA SAID?

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.160
HE SAID NOT TO FUSS,

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:41.579
BECAUSE HE AND GRANDMA
WERE SO PROUD OF YOU.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.123
Kyoko: (GASPS)

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.336
YOU LEFT THIS VILLAGE,
WENT TO UNIVERSITY,

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:50.922
BECAME A SCHOLAR,
AND GOT YOUR WORK PUBLISHED.

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.924
IT MADE HIM SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:55.135
MAKE A NAME FOR YOURSELF
IN THE WORLD.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.848
AND THEN HE TOLD ME
SOMETHING I'LL NEVER FORGET,

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:03.476
THAT SOMEDAY YOU MIGHT GET TIRED
FROM ALL THE HARD WORK YOU DO

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.103
AND NEED A BREAK FROM IT,

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:07.230
AND IF THAT DAY EVER CAME,

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:09.024
HE SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.526
THE HOUSE AND THE MOUNTAIN
WERE ALWAYS THERE,

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:14.571
THAT HE'D GUARD THEM
TO GIVE YOU A PLACE

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.282
TO COME HOME TO
IF YOU NEEDED IT.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:24.831
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT THEN,

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.375
BUT NOW, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME,

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.961
I THINK I FINALLY DO.

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:33.131
LIFE ISN'T JUST ABOUT DOING
THE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY.

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.842
IT'S ALSO
ABOUT FINDING A WAY TO LIVE

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:40.555
WHERE THE HAPPINESS OF EVERYONE
AROUND YOU FULFILLS YOU, TOO.

00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:44.476
SOMEHOW, I WANT TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO LIVE A LIFE

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.811
THAT MAKES
EVERYONE AROUND ME HAPPY.

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.647
I WANT A LIFE
THAT LETS ME BE THERE

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:53.026
FOR THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT WHEN
THEY NEED SOMEONE TO LEAN ON.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.903
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.238
MOTHER, I'LL STUDY
AND WORK HARD,

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.450
BUT I WANT TO KEEP GOING
TO THE SCHOOL THAT I LOVE.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:16.466
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.890
MOM.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.683
Kyoko: (GASPS)

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.268
WHAT IS THIS?

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.688
THIS IS CRAZY.
I'M NOT REALLY CRYING.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.357
Asuna: MOM.

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:36.194
YOU CAN'T HIDE IT
WHEN YOU'RE SAD IN THIS WORLD.

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:39.572
WHEN YOU CRY,
YOU CRY JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE.

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:43.827
Kyoko: SUCH AN ANNOYING WORLD.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.870
(CRYING)

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:17.610
Asuna: MORNING, MOM.

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:19.946
Kyoko: MORNING.

00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:24.868
ASUNA, ARE YOU
DETERMINED TO LIVE

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.412
THE KIND OF SELFLESS LIFE
YOU SPOKE OF?

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:29.622
Asuna: MM‐HMM.

00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:32.250
Kyoko: FINE.
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT,

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:35.545
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO CARRY THAT BURDEN,

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:38.464
SO MAKE SURE YOU GO TO COLLEGE,

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:41.509
AND FOR THAT,
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET BETTER GRADES

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.469
THIS TRIMESTER AND NEXT YEAR.

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:44.929
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.681
REALLY?

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:48.474
THEN I CAN STAY?

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:49.934
Kyoko: THAT'S UP TO YOU.

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:51.436
YOU'LL HAVE TO PROVE YOURSELF.

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:56.191
DO YOUR BEST.

00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:01.613
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.656
Asuna: THANKS, MOM. I WILL.

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:07.744
THANK YOU, YUUKI.

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:14.667
HERE I GO.
