WEBVTT

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:21.068
Kirito: HUH. THERE'S NO ONE
ANYWHERE NEAR US.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.329
DEATH GUN AND SINON
AREN'T ON THE MAP,

00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.458
BUT COUNTING THEM,
THERE'S SIX PLAYERS LEFT.

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:36.459
HUH?

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:38.627
THEY TOOK EACH OTHER OUT.

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:40.796
THAT LEAVES FOUR.

00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:42.173
(GASPS)

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:46.343
30 PLAYERS STARTED.

00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:48.679
24 ARE OUT, SO THAT LEAVES SIX.

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.347
ME AND YAMIKAZE

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:52.808
AND SINON AND DEATH GUN,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.809
THAT'S 28,

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.520
AND PALE RIDER MAKES IT 29.

00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:00.066
WE'RE SHORT A PLAYER.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:04.028
DID DEATH GUN
MURDER SOMEONE ELSE

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.821
AFTER HE GOT PALE RIDER?

00:01:05.863 --> 00:01:09.617
NO. HIS PARTNER'S BEEN WAITING
AT SINON'S FOR HIS CUE.

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:12.244
HE CAN'T BE TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:13.746
UNLESS...

00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:16.916
THERE'S ANOTHER ANGLE
TO THIS I'M MISSING.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:02.940
(ROCKS SLIDE)

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:03.983
Sinon: (GASPS)

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:07.278
WELL, WHAT'D YOU FIND?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.280
Kirito: THERE'S FIVE OF US LEFT,

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.532
YOU, ME, YAMIKAZE‐‐

00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:13.534
I DIDN'T SEE DEATH GUN, THOUGH.

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:15.745
AND THERE'S ANOTHER PLAYER
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:17.622
THE SCAN DIDN'T PICK HIM UP,

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.999
SO THEY MIGHT BE HIDING
IN A CAVE LIKE US.

00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:23.586
Sinon: THAT'S IT, JUST US FIVE?

00:03:23.628 --> 00:03:27.381
WELL, IT'S BEEN AN HOUR
AND 45 MINUTES ALREADY.

00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:31.052
SEEING AS HOW THE LAST B.o.B.
ENDED IN ABOUT TWO HOURS,

00:03:31.093 --> 00:03:33.179
THIS ONE'S RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.849
HEH. I'M SURPRISED NO ONE'S
CHUCKED A GRENADE IN HERE YET.

00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:40.311
Kirito: YEAH. MAYBE WE'VE GOT
DEATH GUN TO THANK FOR THAT.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.563
COULD BE
WHILE HE'S LOOKING FOR US,

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:44.231
HE'S WHITTLING DOWN
THE COMPETITION

00:03:44.273 --> 00:03:46.025
WITH THAT RIFLE OF HIS.

00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:49.153
Sinon: IF YOU'RE RIGHT,

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.697
THEN HE'S A SHOO‐IN
FOR THE MAX‐KILLS AWARD.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.449
WHATEVER.

00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:55.117
WE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT YAMIKAZE.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.871
YOU WERE PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE
WHO SHOWED UP ON HIS TERMINAL,

00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:01.832
SO WE BETTER GET READY,
'CAUSE HE'LL BE COMING FOR YOU.

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:03.125
Kirito: HE ANY GOOD?

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.753
Sinon: HE WAS RUNNER‐UP
IN THE LAST B.o.B.

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:08.047
HE'S YOUR TYPICAL
FULL‐ON AGI TYPE.

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.466
THEY CALL HIM THE RUN‐GUN DEMON
OR SOMETHING.

00:04:10.508 --> 00:04:12.510
Kirito: UH, RUN WHAT?

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:13.970
Sinon: RUN AND GUN.

00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:17.098
YOU RUN, SHOOT, RUN.
IT'S A STYLE OF COMBAT.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.976
HIS MAIN WEAPON'S
A CALICO M900A,

00:04:20.017 --> 00:04:21.811
AN ULTRALIGHT SUBMACHINE GUN.

00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:25.439
YAMIKAZE COULDN'T COMPETE
WITH XEXEED's RARE GUN AND ARMOR

00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:26.774
IN THE LAST TOURNEY,

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:28.693
BUT EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T WIN,

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:30.987
SOME PEOPLE SAY
HE'S THE BETTER PLAYER.

00:04:35.783 --> 00:04:38.244
Kirito: WHOA.
HE'S REALLY THAT GOOD?

00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:41.580
LIKE THE BEST PLAYER
ON JAPAN'S G.G.O. SERVER GOOD?

00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:43.457
Sinon: YEAH, HE IS,

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:46.085
AND HE MIGHT BE
OUR ACE IN THE HOLE, TOO.

00:04:46.127 --> 00:04:47.712
IF YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT DEATH GUN,

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:49.880
THEN I'M THE ONLY ONE
HE'S READY TO KILL.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:52.717
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE HIS PARTNER'S

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:55.261
WAITING BACK AT MY APARTMENT
RIGHT NOW.

00:04:55.303 --> 00:04:57.805
SEE, I FIGURE
THAT IF THAT'S THE CASE,

00:04:57.847 --> 00:05:00.683
YAMIKAZE'S NOT IN ANY
REAL DANGER OF GETTING KILLED.

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:02.476
THIS IS GONNA SOUND COLD,

00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:06.480
BUT I WAS THINKING HE WOULD MAKE
THE PERFECT DECOY FOR US.

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:08.733
WHEN DEATH GUN SHOOTS YAMIKAZE,

00:05:08.774 --> 00:05:10.443
WE'LL KNOW WHERE HE IS.

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:14.447
IN A WAY, WE GOT TWO DECOYS,

00:05:14.488 --> 00:05:17.742
HIM IN HERE AND ME I.R.L.

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:19.493
Kirito:
YOU'RE PRETTY BRAVE, SINON.

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:20.536
Sinon: HUH?

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:24.915
NOT EVEN. I'M TRYING
NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT,

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:28.586
TRYING TO AVOID WHAT SCARES ME,
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:31.130
ANYWAY, YOU THINK IT'LL WORK?

00:05:31.172 --> 00:05:34.383
Kirito: YEAH. I MEAN,
IT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

00:05:35.593 --> 00:05:37.678
ALTHOUGH THERE'S
STILL ONE THING

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.888
THAT BOTHERS ME.

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:40.890
JUST NOW, WHEN I ADDED UP

00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:43.434
THE PLAYERS WHO WERE LEFT
AND WHO WERE DONE,

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.436
I COULD ONLY COME UP WITH 28.

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:48.397
PALE RIDER'S 29,
BUT STILL, WE'RE SHORT ONE.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:50.066
Sinon: NO WAY.
COULD DEATH GUN

00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:52.485
HAVE KILLED SOMEONE ELSE
AFTER HE TRIED FOR ME?

00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:55.654
HOW'S THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
I MEAN, HIS NUMBER TWO'S

00:05:55.696 --> 00:05:57.990
SUPPOSED BE WAITING
AT MY PLACE NOW.

00:05:58.032 --> 00:06:00.743
Kirito: RIGHT.
THAT'S HOW I FIGURED IT, TOO,

00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:04.038
BUT NOW I'M THINKING
SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.624
BETWEEN THE TIME DEATH GUN
SHOT PALE RIDER

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:11.212
AND WHEN HE TRIED FOR YOU,
ONLY 30 MINUTES HAD GONE BY,

00:06:11.253 --> 00:06:12.671
SO BASED ON MY THEORY,

00:06:12.713 --> 00:06:14.882
PALE RIDER'S APARTMENT
WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:06:14.924 --> 00:06:17.760
NO MORE THAN 30 MINUTES
AWAY FROM YOUR PLACE.

00:06:17.802 --> 00:06:20.179
THAT'S KIND OF CONVENIENT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:06:20.221 --> 00:06:21.472
Sinon: I GUESS,

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.432
BUT WHAT OTHER EXPLANATION
IS THERE FOR IT?

00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:26.519
Kirito: MAYBE DEATH GUN ISN'T
WORKING WITH JUST THE ONE GUY.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.397
LIKE MAYBE HE'S GOT
A FEW MORE PARTNERS.

00:06:29.438 --> 00:06:33.067
IF HE DOES, THEN IT'D BE
POSSIBLE TO KILL ONE PLAYER

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:36.362
WHILE STILL HAVING SOMEONE
AVAILABLE TO KILL YOU

00:06:36.404 --> 00:06:38.656
AND ONE FOR YAMIKAZE.

00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:40.908
HE COULD BE A TARGET NOW, TOO.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.827
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

00:06:42.868 --> 00:06:43.828
(GUNSHOT)

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:44.912
Yamikaze: (GROANS)

00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:48.624
Sinon: (GASPS)

00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:50.417
OH, MY GOD.

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:53.003
IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND THERE'S
MORE OF 'EM OUT THERE,

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.838
HOW MANY MORE
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.090
Kirito: IF THEY'RE ALL
EX‐LAUGHING COFFIN,

00:06:57.132 --> 00:06:59.551
AT LEAST 10, MAYBE MORE.

00:06:59.593 --> 00:07:01.928
I DOUBT THEY'RE ALL
INVOLVED WITH THIS,

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.597
BUT WE CAN'T BE SURE

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.516
THERE'S ONLY ONE REAL‐WORLD
KILLER OUT THERE ANYMORE.

00:07:06.558 --> 00:07:09.645
Sinon: THEY'RE CRAZY.
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY DO THIS

00:07:09.686 --> 00:07:11.730
AFTER GETTING OUT
OF S.A.O. ALIVE?

00:07:11.772 --> 00:07:15.108
HOW COULD ANYONE STAY
A PLAYER‐KILLER AFTER THAT GAME?

00:07:16.526 --> 00:07:19.571
Kirito:
FOR THE SAME REASON AS US.

00:07:19.613 --> 00:07:22.407
WHY DO I KEEP BEING A SWORDSMAN

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.118
AND YOU A SNIPER?

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:27.120
(RIFLE RATTLES)

00:07:27.162 --> 00:07:28.497
Sinon: I CALLED 'EM P. K.‐ERS,

00:07:28.538 --> 00:07:29.873
BUT I TAKE IT BACK.

00:07:29.915 --> 00:07:33.001
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE
WHO P. K. IN THIS GAME.

00:07:33.043 --> 00:07:36.004
I USED TO RUN WITH A SQUAD
OF P. K.‐ERS MYSELF.

00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:37.756
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:07:37.798 --> 00:07:39.800
P.K.‐ERS HAVE A CODE OF HONOR
THEY STICK TO.

00:07:39.841 --> 00:07:41.718
THEY'RE NOT P. K.‐ERS.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.429
THEY KILL PEOPLE WITH POISON
WHILE THEY'RE UNCONSCIOUS

00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:46.181
LIKE A BUNCH OF COWARDS.

00:07:46.223 --> 00:07:48.225
THERE'S NO HONOR IN MURDER.

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:51.144
THAT'S CHICKENSHIT, STRAIGHT UP,

00:07:51.186 --> 00:07:53.897
AND WE CAN'T LET THEM
GET AWAY WITH IT.

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.440
Kirito: NO, WE CAN'T.

00:07:55.482 --> 00:07:58.193
WE'VE GOT A CHANCE
TO STOP THESE PEOPLE,

00:07:58.235 --> 00:07:59.861
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT.

00:07:59.903 --> 00:08:02.280
DEATH GUN'S GOING DOWN
ON THIS BATTLEFIELD.

00:08:02.322 --> 00:08:04.658
IT'S OVER FOR HIM AND HIS PALS.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.368
I'LL MAKE 'EM ALL PAY.

00:08:07.744 --> 00:08:09.037
YEAH,

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:12.374
THIS IS HOW I MAKE AMENDS
FOR WHAT I DID,

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:15.210
FOR LOSING IT
IN THE CHAOS OF BATTLE,

00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:18.296
FOR KILLING THOSE TWO PLAYERS
THAT NIGHT

00:08:18.338 --> 00:08:20.298
AND THE OTHER ONE LATER ON.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.759
THIS IS HOW I'LL GET CLOSURE.

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:25.178
I'LL PROTECT SINON,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.596
TAKE OUT YAMIKAZE,

00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:28.181
AND END DEATH GUN.

00:08:28.223 --> 00:08:31.852
IT WON'T BE EASY,
BUT IT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

00:08:31.893 --> 00:08:34.354
Sinon: I'M GONNA
TAKE YAMIKAZE OUT.

00:08:34.396 --> 00:08:36.690
I WON'T LET DEATH GUN KILL HIM.

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:37.691
Kirito: HUH?

00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:39.067
Sinon: YAMIKAZE'S TOUGH.

00:08:39.109 --> 00:08:42.070
I DOUBT EVEN YOU
COULD FINISH HIM WITH ONE HIT,

00:08:42.112 --> 00:08:45.657
AND IF HE'S BUSY WITH YOU,
DEATH GUN'S SURE TO GO FOR HIM.

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:48.035
Kirito: THEN HOW ARE WE
GONNA DEAL WITH THAT?

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:49.786
Sinon: DID YOU FORGET WHAT I AM?

00:08:51.079 --> 00:08:52.414
I'M A SNIPER.

00:08:52.456 --> 00:08:55.083
I'LL HAVE EYES ON YOU
THE WHOLE TIME,

00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:57.794
SO ONCE THEY MOVE ON YOU,
I'LL KNOW THEIR LOCATIONS.

00:08:57.836 --> 00:09:00.839
I'LL HIT YAMIKAZE FIRST.
THEN I'LL GO FOR DEATH GUN.

00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:02.716
Kirito: OKAY, THEN.

00:09:04.217 --> 00:09:05.594
WE GO WITH YOUR PLAN.

00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:06.887
ALL RIGHT.

00:09:06.928 --> 00:09:09.723
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE
PRETTY CLOSE BY NOW.

00:09:09.765 --> 00:09:12.059
I'M GONNA HOP ON THE BUGGY
AND HEAD OUT.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.810
LEAVE THE CAVE RIGHT AFTER I DO,

00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:16.146
AND GET SET UP
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:26.865
Sinon:
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE, PARTNER.

00:09:29.618 --> 00:09:30.911
(CHUCKLES)

00:09:54.645 --> 00:09:55.729
(GASPS)

00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:57.815
YAMIKAZE'S COMING FROM THE WEST,

00:09:57.856 --> 00:10:00.484
SO IF A SHOT
COMES FROM THE EAST,

00:10:00.526 --> 00:10:02.736
IT'LL PROBABLY BE DEATH GUN.

00:10:02.778 --> 00:10:04.154
HE'S GOT THAT CLOAK,

00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:06.490
SO WHEN HE SHOOTS,
HE'LL BE INVISIBLE.

00:10:06.532 --> 00:10:10.202
IF HE HITS KIRITO IN THE HEART
OR HEAD, IT'S OVER.

00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:14.665
BUT IF YOU CAN CUT
MY BULLET IN HALF,

00:10:14.706 --> 00:10:16.500
YOU CAN DODGE HIS, RIGHT?

00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:17.960
RIGHT, KIRITO?

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:20.254
MY FIRST PRIORITY

00:10:20.295 --> 00:10:22.589
IS TAKING YAMIKAZE
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:25.259
IF I MISS, KIRITO WILL GET SHOT.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.679
THEN DEATH GUN
WILL FIND ME AND KILL ME.

00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:31.807
MY LIFE, MY REAL LIFE,

00:10:31.849 --> 00:10:35.894
DEPENDS ON A SINGLE BULLET,
LIKE IT DID THAT DAY.

00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:42.693
PLEASE, HECATE.

00:10:42.734 --> 00:10:45.779
I'M WEAK,
AND I NEED YOUR STRENGTH,

00:10:45.821 --> 00:10:48.657
THE STRENGTH
TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:50.075
AND MOVE ON.

00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:06.466
Kirito: (SIGHS)

00:11:13.682 --> 00:11:15.392
SOUTHWEST.

00:11:15.434 --> 00:11:17.394
THAT'S YAMIKAZE.

00:11:17.436 --> 00:11:20.022
DON'T WORRY. SINON'S GOT HIM.

00:11:20.063 --> 00:11:22.065
(HEART BEATING)

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:25.319
Sinon: WHOA.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.695
Yamikaze: (CHUCKLES)

00:11:27.696 --> 00:11:29.448
Sinon: WHAT DO I DO?

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:31.533
I COULD TRY
TO SHOOT IN FRONT OF HIM

00:11:31.575 --> 00:11:33.410
OR SHOOT AT HIS FEET,
HOPE HE PANICS,

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:35.037
AND THEN TAKE HIM OUT.

00:11:39.082 --> 00:11:41.585
NO. ONCE HE'S
GOT KIRITO IN RANGE,

00:11:41.627 --> 00:11:43.587
HE'LL STOP TO STEADY HIS AIM.

00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:45.964
I HAVE TO WAIT TILL HE DOES.

00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:47.299
I'LL BE PATIENT.

00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:49.843
DON'T WORRY, KIRITO.

00:11:49.885 --> 00:11:52.054
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK.

00:12:02.397 --> 00:12:04.816
Kirito: CONCENTRATE.

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:08.111
HOME IN ON HIS DRIVE TO KILL

00:12:08.153 --> 00:12:09.696
LIKE LAST TIME.

00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:22.584
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:12:22.626 --> 00:12:25.087
I COULD FEEL
THEIR LUST FOR MURDER.

00:12:25.128 --> 00:12:27.256
THAT'S HOW I NOTICED 'EM.

00:12:29.091 --> 00:12:32.386
THE FIRST GUY WHO ATTACKED ME,

00:12:32.427 --> 00:12:34.721
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:44.481
Death Gun: KIRITO,
SOMEDAY I'LL KILL YOU PROPERLY.

00:12:47.693 --> 00:12:49.486
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:12:55.701 --> 00:12:59.871
Death Gun:
SOMEDAY I'LL KILL YOU PROPERLY.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.524
Kirito: YAMIKAZE.

00:13:31.695 --> 00:13:32.738
(YELLS)

00:13:40.495 --> 00:13:41.913
Sinon: (GASPS)

00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:45.292
Yamikaze: (GASPS)

00:13:46.752 --> 00:13:49.004
(GASPS)

00:13:59.181 --> 00:14:00.849
Sinon: KIRITO.

00:14:16.448 --> 00:14:17.783
GOTCHA.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.748
(GASPS)

00:14:57.989 --> 00:15:01.576
IT'S UP TO YOU NOW, KIRITO.

00:15:01.618 --> 00:15:02.786
Kirito: SHE DID IT.

00:15:02.828 --> 00:15:04.496
NOW IT'S MY TURN. (GASPS)

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.047
(YELLS)

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.352
(GASPS)

00:15:30.147 --> 00:15:32.816
Sinon: (GASPS) KIRITO.

00:15:36.613 --> 00:15:38.740
Yui: DON'T WORRY, MOMMY.

00:15:38.782 --> 00:15:42.452
NO MATTER HOW STRONG
HIS ENEMY IS, DADDY WONT LOSE.

00:15:42.494 --> 00:15:44.705
HE'S DADDY, AFTER ALL.

00:15:46.123 --> 00:15:47.457
Asuna: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:51.920
Yui: TURN LEFT.
HIS ROOM IS EIGHT METERS DOWN.

00:15:51.962 --> 00:15:53.380
Aki: KIRIGAYA?

00:15:53.422 --> 00:15:56.466
Kirito: (BREATHING HEAVILY)

00:15:56.508 --> 00:15:57.676
Asuna: KIRITO!

00:15:57.718 --> 00:15:59.386
Aki: MISS YUUKI, RIGHT?

00:15:59.428 --> 00:16:01.054
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

00:16:01.096 --> 00:16:03.765
Asuna: IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH KI‐‐I MEAN KAZUTO?

00:16:03.807 --> 00:16:05.184
Aki: NO, HE'S OKAY.

00:16:05.225 --> 00:16:08.103
I KNOW IT LOOKS BAD,
BUT HE'S NOT IN DANGER.

00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:09.855
HIS HEART RATE SPIKED, IS ALL.

00:16:09.897 --> 00:16:12.441
Asuna: HIS HEART RATE?

00:16:13.901 --> 00:16:16.320
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:16:16.361 --> 00:16:19.948
Yui: MOMMY, LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT
AT THE MONITOR ON THE WALL.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.366
I'M GOING TO PATCH IN

00:16:21.408 --> 00:16:23.452
THE LIVE FOOTAGE
FROM THE MMO STREAM.

00:16:24.703 --> 00:16:25.746
Aki: HUH?

00:16:35.547 --> 00:16:38.091
Asuna: IS THAT KIRITO?

00:16:38.133 --> 00:16:39.551
Aki: THAT'S KIRIGAYA'S AVATAR

00:16:39.592 --> 00:16:41.800
FROM THE GAME
HE'S DIVING IN NOW?

00:16:41.842 --> 00:16:44.052
Asuna: UH‐HUH. HE'S IN BATTLE.

00:16:44.094 --> 00:16:47.556
I THINK THAT'S WHY
HIS HEART'S RACING SO MUCH.

00:16:47.598 --> 00:16:48.599
(GASPS)

00:16:49.683 --> 00:16:51.602
AN ESTOC.

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:54.771
(GASPS) THAT'S IT.

00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:58.191
ONE OF LAUGHING COFFIN'S LEADERS
WAS A MASTER WITH AN ESTOC,

00:16:58.233 --> 00:17:01.278
BUT WHAT WAS HE CALLED?

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:04.197
"STERBEN"?

00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:06.283
ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE STEVEN?

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.284
Aki: IT'S NOT.

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:08.285
Yui: SHE'S RIGHT.

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:09.953
Aki: IT'S A GERMAN WORD.

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.956
I KNOW IT.
IT'S A MEDICAL TERM WE USE.

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:15.584
IT'S PRONOUNCED "SHTERBEN."

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:17.920
Asuna: "SHTERBEN"?

00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:20.172
Aki: IT MEANS "TO DIE."

00:17:20.214 --> 00:17:24.259
IN HOSPITALS, WE USE THAT WORD
WHEN A PATIENT'S PASSED AWAY.

00:17:24.301 --> 00:17:26.345
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:17:26.386 --> 00:17:29.306
Kirito: (BREATHING HEAVILY)

00:17:30.474 --> 00:17:31.892
Asuna: KIRITO.

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.899
Kirito: HEH.

00:17:38.941 --> 00:17:41.026
THAT'S AN INTERESTING WEAPON
YOU'VE GOT THERE.

00:17:41.068 --> 00:17:43.237
IF I'D KNOWN THERE WERE
METAL SWORDS IN G.G.O.,

00:17:43.278 --> 00:17:45.239
I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
MY HANDS ON ONE.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.908
Death Gun: YOU SHOULD
HAVE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.786
BEFORE LOGGING IN,
BLACK SWORDSMAN.

00:17:50.827 --> 00:17:53.747
I MADE THIS
WITH THE WEAPON CREATION SKILL.

00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:56.041
IT CAN'T BE
ANY LONGER OR HEAVIER,

00:17:56.083 --> 00:17:57.793
BUT IT DOES THE TRICK.

00:17:57.834 --> 00:17:59.920
Kirito: WOW. IF THAT'S
THE BEST SWORD I CAN MAKE,

00:17:59.962 --> 00:18:02.297
THEN I GUESS I COULDN'T MAKE ONE
I'D BE HAPPY WITH.

00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:06.301
Death Gun: STILL INTO SWORDS
WITH HIGH STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS?

00:18:06.343 --> 00:18:07.886
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

00:18:07.928 --> 00:18:10.180
MUST BE PRETTY TOUGH FOR YOU,

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:13.225
HAVING TO TWIRL
THAT FLASHLIGHT AROUND.

00:18:13.267 --> 00:18:14.685
(PHOTON SWORD HUMS)

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:17.104
Kirito: THIS THING'S
NOT AS BAD AS ALL THAT.

00:18:17.145 --> 00:18:20.607
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT IT'D BE
LIKE TO FIGHT WITH ONE OF THESE.

00:18:20.649 --> 00:18:23.110
BESIDES, A SWORD'S A SWORD.

00:18:23.151 --> 00:18:26.571
IF I CAN SLASH YOU AND
BURN THROUGH YOUR H.P. WITH IT,

00:18:26.613 --> 00:18:28.073
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

00:18:28.115 --> 00:18:30.575
Death Gun: (CHUCKLES)
YOU TALK A GOOD GAME,

00:18:30.617 --> 00:18:33.370
BUT IT'S ALL TALK.

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:37.833
YOU SUCKED IN TOO MUCH
ROTTEN AIR FROM THE REAL WORLD.

00:18:37.874 --> 00:18:40.252
THAT HALF‐ASS VORPAL STRIKE
YOU JUST PULLED,

00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:43.630
IF THE OLD YOU SAW IT,
HE'D SHAKE HIS HEAD.

00:18:44.673 --> 00:18:45.674
Kirito: MAYBE SO,

00:18:45.716 --> 00:18:47.843
BUT THE SAME GOES FOR YOU, TOO.

00:18:47.884 --> 00:18:49.886
YOU'RE LIVING IN THE PAST.

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:52.806
I BET YOU THINK YOU'RE STILL
A MEMBER OF LAUGHING COFFIN.

00:18:56.143 --> 00:18:57.561
Death Gun: YOU REMEMBER.

00:18:57.602 --> 00:18:59.146
I'M IMPRESSED.

00:18:59.187 --> 00:19:00.689
THEN I GUESS YOU UNDERSTAND

00:19:00.731 --> 00:19:04.026
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

00:19:04.067 --> 00:19:06.945
I'M A GENUINE RED PLAYER,

00:19:06.987 --> 00:19:09.656
WHILE YOU ARE NOT.

00:19:12.868 --> 00:19:15.787
YOU KILLED
ONLY BECAUSE YOU WERE SCARED,

00:19:15.829 --> 00:19:18.457
SCARED AND DESPERATE TO SURVIVE.

00:19:18.498 --> 00:19:20.292
AND INSTEAD OF FACING IT,

00:19:20.334 --> 00:19:23.295
I BET YOU TRIED
TO FORGET IT EVEN HAPPENED,

00:19:23.337 --> 00:19:25.297
JUST LIKE A COWARD.

00:19:25.339 --> 00:19:26.298
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.300
I MIGHT BE A COWARD,

00:19:28.342 --> 00:19:31.678
BUT STILL, I'LL STOP YOU
FROM KILLING AGAIN.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.349
I FIGURED OUT HOW XEXEED
AND THE OTHERS WERE MURDERED.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.727
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT HANDGUN OF YOURS,

00:19:38.769 --> 00:19:41.521
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
SPECIAL POWERS EITHER.

00:19:41.563 --> 00:19:44.608
Death Gun:
HOW'D THOSE PEOPLE DIE THEN?

00:19:44.649 --> 00:19:47.319
Kirito: BACK AT THE TERMINALS
AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE,

00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:48.820
YOU USED THAT CLOAK

00:19:48.862 --> 00:19:51.490
TO SCOPE OUT THE ADDRESSES
OF THE B.o.B. CONTESTANTS.

00:19:51.531 --> 00:19:54.368
THEN YOU HAD SOMEONE
BREAK INTO THEIR APARTMENTS

00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:58.622
AND TIMED IT SO WHEN YOU FIRED,
THEY'D INJECT A DRUG INTO 'EM,

00:19:58.663 --> 00:20:01.208
MAKING IT LOOK
LIKE THEY DIED OF HEART FAILURE.

00:20:01.249 --> 00:20:02.709
THAT'S HOW YOU DID IT.

00:20:02.751 --> 00:20:05.420
THE MINISTRY
OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS

00:20:05.462 --> 00:20:07.547
HAS THE IN‐GAME
AND REAL‐WORLD INFO

00:20:07.589 --> 00:20:09.841
OF EVERY SINGLE PLAYER
FROM S.A.O.

00:20:09.883 --> 00:20:13.470
ONCE THEY GET YOUR HANDLE,
THEY'LL FIND OUT YOUR REAL NAME,

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:16.640
YOUR REAL ADDRESS, AND ALL
THE EVIL SHIT YOU'VE EVER DONE.

00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:18.433
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

00:20:20.811 --> 00:20:22.521
IT'S ALL OVER FOR YOU,

00:20:22.562 --> 00:20:25.524
SO LOG OUT,
AND TURN YOURSELF IN.

00:20:25.565 --> 00:20:29.778
Death Gun: YOU THINK YOU'VE
GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT,

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.154
BUT YOU DON'T.

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:34.449
AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

00:20:34.491 --> 00:20:36.284
WANT TO KNOW WHY?

00:20:36.326 --> 00:20:41.498
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER
REMEMBER WHAT MY HANDLE WAS.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.666
Kirito: YOU THINK SO?

00:20:42.707 --> 00:20:44.793
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE I WON'T?

00:20:44.835 --> 00:20:48.547
Death Gun: (CHUCKLES)
YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER

00:20:48.588 --> 00:20:52.008
THE REASON YOU FORGOT IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.468
THINK BACK.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.388
AFTER THAT BATTLE
BETWEEN YOUR GROUP AND MINE,

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.391
I TRIED TO TELL YOU MY NAME,

00:20:59.433 --> 00:21:01.893
BUT YOU SAID...

00:21:04.438 --> 00:21:06.731
Kirito: THERE'S NO POINT
IN GIVING ME YOUR NAME.

00:21:06.773 --> 00:21:08.358
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW IT.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.820
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.825
(GASPS)

00:21:16.867 --> 00:21:19.161
Death Gun: YOU CAN'T
REMEMBER MY HANDLE,

00:21:19.202 --> 00:21:20.537
AND YOU NEVER WILL.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.706
I NEVER GAVE IT TO YOU,

00:21:22.747 --> 00:21:25.375
AND NOW I'M GOING
TO CUT YOU DOWN.

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.252
I'LL LEAVE YOU LYING HERE,

00:21:27.294 --> 00:21:29.838
WATCHING HELPLESSLY
AS I KILL THE GIRL,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.632
AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME!

00:21:39.139 --> 00:21:40.765
(LAUGHS)

00:21:44.853 --> 00:21:46.646
(CHUCKLES)

00:21:46.688 --> 00:21:48.231
STINGS, DOESN'T IT?

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:52.569
THIS IS MADE FROM THE BEST METAL
YOU CAN GET IN THE GAME.

00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:57.240
IT'S ARMOR PLATING
FROM A SPACE BATTLESHIP.

00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:59.951
