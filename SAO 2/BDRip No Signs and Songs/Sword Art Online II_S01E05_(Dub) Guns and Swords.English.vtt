WEBVTT

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:13.936
Both: (GASP)

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:15.271
Kirito: FIVE MINUTES TO GO.

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:16.564
Sinon: WE HAVE TO HURRY.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:18.232
THIS WAY.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.421
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:02:02.463 --> 00:02:04.423
Sinon: HEY, COME ON.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.307
Kirito, thinking: I WONDER IF
ONE OF THESE GUYS IS DEATH GUN.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.935
Sinon: HERE WE ARE.

00:02:15.977 --> 00:02:18.646
THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE
TO SIGN UP FOR THE TOURNEY.

00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:21.315
IT'S A TYPICAL, RUN‐OF‐THE‐MILL
TOUCH‐PANEL INTERFACE.

00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:23.860
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT,
OR YOU WANT SOME HELP?

00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:25.820
Kirito: NO, I CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:28.614
Sinon: COOL. I'M GONNA BE
OVER AT THE NEXT TERMINAL,

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:30.366
SO IF YOU GET STUCK, HOLLER.

00:02:30.408 --> 00:02:32.076
Kirito: OKAY. THANKS A LOT.

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:39.667
HUH?

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:46.465
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ENTER
OUR REAL‐LIFE INFO?

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.016
HMM.

00:03:04.442 --> 00:03:06.068
‐ Sinon: YOU DONE YET?
‐ Kirito: (GASPS)

00:03:08.613 --> 00:03:09.864
YES, I'M ALL DONE.

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:12.241
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALL YOUR HELP TODAY.

00:03:12.283 --> 00:03:13.326
SORRY FOR ALL THE TROUBLE.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:14.869
Sinon: NO WORRIES.

00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:17.622
THAT CRAZY RIDE ON THE BUGGY
MORE THAN MADE UP FOR IT.

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:21.042
ANYWAY, WHICH BLOCK DID YOU
END UP WITH FOR THE PRELIMS?

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:22.001
Kirito: UM...

00:03:22.043 --> 00:03:25.755
"F," I GUESS, F‐37.

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:27.214
Sinon: OH, REALLY?

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:29.300
I'M IN "F," TOO, NUMBER 12.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.636
THAT'S KIND OF
A COOL COINCIDENCE, HUH?

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.429
WHEN DO WE MEET, THOUGH?

00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:36.515
OH, GOOD. WE'RE NOT GONNA
MEET UP AGAIN TILL THE FINALS.

00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:39.268
Kirito: I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU MEAN. WHY IS THAT GOOD?

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.561
Sinon: IF A PLAYER MAKES IT

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:42.480
TO THE FINAL BRACKET
IN THE PRELIMS,

00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:44.148
IT WON'T MATTER IF THEY LOSE.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.025
THEY'LL AUTOMATICALLY ADVANCE
TO THE BATTLE ROYALE.

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:47.860
THAT MEANS WE BOTH HAVE A SHOT

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:49.445
AT ADVANCING
TO THE BATTLE ROYALE

00:03:49.487 --> 00:03:52.031
AS LONG AS WE MAKE IT
TO THE LAST BRACKET.

00:03:52.073 --> 00:03:53.032
Kirito: OH.

00:03:53.074 --> 00:03:55.034
Sinon: BUT IF WE DO MEET

00:03:55.076 --> 00:03:57.244
IN THE FINAL BRACKET
OF THE PRELIMS,

00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:59.205
I'LL BE PLAYING TO WIN.

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:01.666
Kirito: OH. I GET IT.

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:05.002
ALL RIGHT, IF WE BOTH MAKE IT,
NO HOLDING BACK.

00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:13.511
WOW. I'M IMPRESSED.

00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:16.681
THE JAPANESE TRANSLATION ON
THESE TERMINALS IS PRETTY GOOD.

00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:19.600
THE OFFICIAL SITE
WAS ENGLISH ONLY.

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:21.936
Sinon: WELL, ZASKAR,
THE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:23.938
AND RUNS THE GAME, IS AMERICAN.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.191
THEY PROBABLY HAVE SOME JAPANESE
STAFF TO RUN JAPAN'S SERVER.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:30.111
OH, AND GET THIS.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW,

00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:33.781
BUT G.G.O. OPERATES IN A LEGAL
GRAY ZONE HERE AND IN THE U. S.

00:04:33.823 --> 00:04:35.908
Kirito: 'CAUSE OF ITS
CASH‐CONVERSION SYSTEM, RIGHT?

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.576
Sinon: (CHUCKLES)

00:04:37.618 --> 00:04:40.579
YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING
ON THE COMPANY'S HOME PAGE

00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:42.540
EXCEPT
THE MOST BASIC INFORMATION,

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.500
AND AS FOR MANAGING
YOUR CHARACTER

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:46.168
OR ACCESSING
YOUR E‐MONEY ACCOUNT

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.878
TO CONVERT WHAT YOU EARN,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.630
ANY AND ALL
GAME‐RELATED PROCEDURES

00:04:49.672 --> 00:04:51.966
HAVE TO BE DONE IN THE GAME.

00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:53.009
Kirito: IT'S AMAZING,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.885
SHADY, BUT AMAZING.

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.512
Sinon: IT IS.

00:04:56.554 --> 00:05:00.182
THE GAME'S PRACTICALLY
INDEPENDENT OF THE REAL WORLD.

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.103
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
THE PERSON I AM IN HERE

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:07.148
AND THE REAL ME FEEL LIKE
TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:12.194
SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
WHY I WENT THERE.

00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:15.197
WE SHOULD START HEADING OVER
TO THE PRELIM AREA NOW.

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:16.324
YOU READY TO GO?

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:17.742
‐ Kirito: SURE.
‐ Sinon: THAT WAY.

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:19.118
IT'S IN THE BASEMENT.

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:29.378
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:41.724
Sinon: SOMETHING WRONG?

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:43.642
Kirito: HUH? NO, NOTHING.

00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:44.852
Sinon: GOOD.

00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:47.146
LET'S GO
TO THE WAITING ROOM FIRST.

00:05:47.188 --> 00:05:48.814
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME PRIVACY

00:05:48.856 --> 00:05:51.150
TO CHANGE
INTO YOUR NEW COMBAT SUIT.

00:05:51.192 --> 00:05:52.193
Kirito: RIGHT.

00:05:58.783 --> 00:06:00.117
(GASPS)

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:08.459
Sinon: (SIGHS)

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:11.462
I SWEAR,
WHAT A BUNCH OF DUMB‐ASSES.

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.714
Kirito: HUH? WHO DO YOU MEAN?

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:15.716
THOSE TOUGH‐LOOKING GUYS
OUTSIDE?

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:17.051
Sinon: YEAH, THEM.

00:06:17.093 --> 00:06:18.677
IT'S A HALF‐HOUR
BEFORE THE MATCH,

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:20.888
AND THEY'RE OUT THERE
SHOWING OFF THEIR MAIN WEAPONS.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.181
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE ASKING YOU

00:06:22.223 --> 00:06:23.808
TO COME UP
WITH A COUNTERMEASURE.

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.976
Kirito: OH.
YEAH, THAT IS SILLY.

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:27.686
Sinon: PIECE OF ADVICE,

00:06:27.728 --> 00:06:29.772
DON'T EQUIP YOUR PHOTON SWORD
AND FIVE SEVEN

00:06:29.814 --> 00:06:31.357
TILL JUST BEFORE
YOUR MATCH STARTS.

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:32.483
Kirito: MM‐HMM.

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:38.197
(GASPS)

00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:42.076
Sinon: HUH?

00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:43.410
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:45.412
HURRY UP,
AND GET CHANGED ALREADY.

00:06:45.454 --> 00:06:47.748
Kirito: UH, YES.
I MEAN, I CAN'T.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.667
I MEAN I CAN'T CHANGE NOW!

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:51.293
I‐‐I MEAN‐‐

00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:52.294
I'M SORRY!

00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:53.546
Sinon: WHY?

00:06:53.587 --> 00:06:55.422
Kirito: I HAVEN'T
INTRODUCED MYSELF.

00:06:55.464 --> 00:06:57.591
THIS IS WHO I REALLY AM.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:06:59.510
Sinon: OKAY.

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:02.054
KIRITO. HUH.

00:07:02.096 --> 00:07:05.432
WELL, IT'S AN INTERESTING NAME.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

00:07:05.474 --> 00:07:06.475
WAIT.

00:07:06.517 --> 00:07:08.727
MALE?! BUT...

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:10.646
I‐‐YOU‐‐

00:07:10.688 --> 00:07:12.606
YOU'RE A‐‐YOU'RE KIDDING.

00:07:12.648 --> 00:07:13.607
NO WAY.

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:15.442
YOU'RE A GUY?

00:07:15.484 --> 00:07:17.653
WITH THAT AVATAR?!

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:21.574
UH...

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:36.046
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:38.048
Sinon: (GROWLS)

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.675
WHY, YOU...

00:07:39.717 --> 00:07:40.718
(SLAP)

00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:52.940
STOP FOLLOWING ME.

00:07:52.981 --> 00:07:54.316
Kirito: BUT I'M NOT SURE

00:07:54.358 --> 00:07:56.402
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO
AFTER THIS.

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:57.778
Sinon: STOP FOLLOWING ME.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.987
Kirito: OKAY,

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:01.198
BUT I DON'T KNOW
ANYONE ELSE HERE.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.741
Sinon: STOP FOLLOWING ME.

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:04.702
Kirito: BUT‐‐BUT I...

00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:11.291
Sinon: (INHALES)

00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:18.215
(EXHALES)

00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:34.106
(GROANS)

00:08:34.148 --> 00:08:36.775
I'LL EXPLAIN IT,
BUT JUST THE BARE MINIMUM.

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:38.110
THAT'S IT. AFTER THAT,

00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:39.778
YOU AND ME ARE ENEMIES.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.779
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.073
THANKS. I APPRECIATE IT.

00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:45.409
Sinon: YEAH, WELL,
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

00:08:45.451 --> 00:08:47.286
THIS DOESN'T MEAN I FORGIVE YOU.

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:49.204
YOU SEE THAT CLOCK UP THERE?

00:08:49.246 --> 00:08:51.123
WHEN IT HITS ZERO,

00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:54.168
EVERYONE HERE WILL AUTOMATICALLY
BE TRANSFERRED TO A BATTLEFIELD.

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:56.837
ALONG WITH WHOEVER THEIR
FIRST‐ROUND OPPONENT'S GONNA BE.

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:58.505
YOU WITH ME SO FAR?

00:08:58.547 --> 00:09:00.632
Kirito: UH, YEAH.

00:09:01.717 --> 00:09:03.343
Sinon: THE FIELD'S A SQUARE.

00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:04.970
EACH SIDE'S A KILOMETER.

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:08.307
THE WEATHER, TERRAIN, AND TIME
ARE ALL RANDOMLY GENERATED.

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:11.810
YOUR OPPONENT'S PLACED
500 METERS AWAY FROM YOU.

00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:14.772
WHOEVER WINS THE MATCH
GETS TRANSFERRED BACK HERE.

00:09:16.273 --> 00:09:19.568
THE LOSER'S TRANSFERRED
TO THE FIRST‐FLOOR HALL,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.863
AND YOU DON'T GET PENALIZED
FOR LOSING A MATCH.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.992
THERE ARE SIXTY‐FOUR PEOPLE
IN BLOCK "F,"

00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:29.161
SO FIVE WINS
WILL TAKE YOU TO THE FINAL,

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:31.830
AND YOU'LL BE ELIGIBLE
FOR THE BATTLE ROYALE.

00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:33.624
THAT'S IT. NO MORE QUESTIONS.

00:09:33.665 --> 00:09:34.958
I'M DONE HELPING YOU.

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.836
Kirito: I THINK
I GOT THE GIST OF IT,

00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:38.879
AND THANKS AGAIN.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.923
Sinon: HMPH.

00:09:40.964 --> 00:09:42.591
YOU BETTER REACH THE FINALS,

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:45.260
'CAUSE EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING
I TAUGHT YOU TODAY,

00:09:45.302 --> 00:09:47.679
THERE'S ONE THING LEFT
FOR YOU TO LEARN.

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:49.389
Kirito: YEAH? WHAT?

00:09:49.431 --> 00:09:52.559
Sinon: THE TASTE
OF THE BULLET THAT BEATS YOU.

00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:57.523
Kirito: I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

00:09:57.564 --> 00:09:58.816
WHAT ABOUT YOU, THOUGH?

00:09:58.857 --> 00:10:00.692
YOU THINK YOU'LL MAKE IT
TO THE FINALS?

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:03.529
Sinon: HEH. I'LL RETIRE IF I
GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE PRELIMS.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.489
BUT I WON'T.

00:10:08.325 --> 00:10:10.994
NOT THIS TIME.

00:10:11.036 --> 00:10:14.373
THIS TIME, I'LL KILL
ALL THE STRONG PLAYERS.

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:15.833
HEH.

00:10:20.712 --> 00:10:24.133
SINCE THIS IS THE LAST TIME
WE'LL BE CHATTING LIKE THIS,

00:10:24.174 --> 00:10:26.677
YOU SHOULD KNOW MY NAME.
THERE IT IS,

00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:30.139
THE NAME OF THE PERSON
WHO'S GONNA BEAT YOU.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.099
Kirito: SINON.

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:35.686
I'M KIRITO.

00:10:35.727 --> 00:10:36.812
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:10:39.565 --> 00:10:41.191
Sinon: (SCOFFS)

00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:42.276
Kirito: (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:43.527
Spiegel: HEY.

00:10:43.569 --> 00:10:45.112
ABOUT TIME YOU SHOWED UP.

00:10:45.154 --> 00:10:46.697
I COULDN'T FIND YOU ANYWHERE,

00:10:46.738 --> 00:10:48.532
AND I WAS WORRIED
YOU WEREN'T GONNA MAKE IT.

00:10:48.574 --> 00:10:50.492
Sinon:
SORRY ABOUT THAT, SPIEGEL.

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:54.163
I TOTALLY LOST TRACK OF TIME
THANKS TO AN UNEXPECTED CHORE.

00:10:54.204 --> 00:10:56.790
HEY, HANG ON.
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T COMPETING.

00:10:56.832 --> 00:10:58.333
DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:00.836
Spiegel: WELL, EVEN THOUGH
I KNOW HOW MUCH IT BUGS YOU,

00:11:00.878 --> 00:11:03.380
I THOUGHT I'D SORT OF
CHEER YOU ON FROM THE SIDELINES.

00:11:03.422 --> 00:11:04.965
I ALREADY PICKED OUT A SPOT

00:11:05.007 --> 00:11:07.092
IN FRONT OF THE JUMBO SCREEN
AND EVERYTHING.

00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:10.053
WHAT WAS THAT UNEXPECTED CHORE
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

00:11:10.095 --> 00:11:11.555
Sinon: OH, NOTHING.

00:11:11.597 --> 00:11:14.850
I WAS JUST GIVING THIS PERSON
A SORT OF ORIENTATION.

00:11:14.892 --> 00:11:17.769
Kirito: THAT'D BE ME.
HI. HOW'S IT GOING?

00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:20.814
Spiegel: OH, HI.
IT'S, UH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:11:20.856 --> 00:11:24.067
SO, UH, ARE YOU
A FRIEND OF SINON'S?

00:11:24.109 --> 00:11:27.738
Sinon: HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
BUT SHE'S A DUDE.

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:29.990
Kirito: YEAH.
MY NAME'S KIRITO.

00:11:30.032 --> 00:11:31.617
I'M A DUDE.

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:33.202
Spiegel: A‐‐A GUY?

00:11:33.243 --> 00:11:36.205
THEN DOES THAT MEAN HE'S A‐‐
THAT YOU'RE‐‐

00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:37.581
Kirito: NOT EVEN.

00:11:37.623 --> 00:11:39.750
HEY, SINON, THANKS FOR
SHOWING ME A GOOD TIME.

00:11:39.791 --> 00:11:41.168
IT WAS A GREAT FIRST DATE.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.502
Sinon: WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU SAYING?

00:11:42.544 --> 00:11:43.754
IT WASN'T A GOOD TIME,

00:11:43.795 --> 00:11:45.756
AND IT WAS NOT A DATE.
IT WAS A MISTAKE,

00:11:45.797 --> 00:11:47.549
SO FORGET MY NAME,
AND FORGET WE EVER MET.

00:11:47.591 --> 00:11:49.801
Kirito: OH, COME ON.
DON'T BE SO HEARTLESS.

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:52.221
Sinon: HEARTLESS, MY ASS.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

00:11:52.262 --> 00:11:54.223
Kirito: BUT WE SPENT
THE WHOLE DAY TOGETHER

00:11:54.264 --> 00:11:55.474
PICKING OUT ALL MY GEAR.

00:11:55.515 --> 00:11:57.935
Sinon: YEAH,
BUT ONLY 'CAUSE YOU LI‐‐

00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:00.854
Announcer: THANK YOU
FOR YOUR PATIENCE, PLAYERS.

00:12:00.896 --> 00:12:02.898
I HOPE YOU'RE READY,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.858
BECAUSE THE THIRD
BULLET OF BULLETS

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.860
PRELIMINARY TOURNAMENT
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

00:12:06.902 --> 00:12:09.780
WHEN THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK
REACHES ZERO,

00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:13.242
ALL COMPETING PLAYERS WILL BE
AUTOMATICALLY TRANSPORTED

00:12:13.283 --> 00:12:16.078
TO THEIR RESPECTIVE
FIRST‐ROUND FIELD MAPS.

00:12:16.119 --> 00:12:18.538
GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.582
‐ Players: (CHEERING)
‐ (GUNS FIRING)

00:12:24.753 --> 00:12:27.047
Sinon: YOU BETTER
MAKE IT TO THE FINALS,

00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:29.591
'CAUSE I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO BLOWING YOUR HEAD OFF.

00:12:31.093 --> 00:12:32.719
Kirito: I ACCEPT THE INVITATION,

00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:34.846
BUT DON'T KEEP ME
WAITING TOO LONG.

00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:37.557
Sinon: (GASPS) WHY, YOU...

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.646
Kirito: HEH.

00:12:42.688 --> 00:12:44.606
Sinon: (GROWLS)

00:12:48.527 --> 00:12:51.530
Kirito: MAYBE I WENT
A LITTLE TOO FAR THERE.

00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:19.099
Sinon: THIS TIME, I'LL KILL
ALL THE STRONG PLAYERS.

00:13:21.685 --> 00:13:23.186
Kirito: IS THAT POSSIBLE?

00:13:23.228 --> 00:13:25.230
COULD SHE BE DEATH GUN?

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:29.067
I SAW TWO SIDES OF HER,

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:31.028
BUT WHICH IS THE REAL SINON?

00:13:32.404 --> 00:13:34.698
I WON'T FIND OUT
STANDING HERE,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.116
THINKING ABOUT IT.

00:13:36.158 --> 00:13:38.869
BUT IF WE CROSSED SWORDS‐‐

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.288
I MEAN TRADED SHOTS,

00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:43.999
I'M SURE I'LL FIND THE ANSWER.

00:14:33.465 --> 00:14:34.716
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.772
I CAN'T DODGE ALL THOSE BULLETS.

00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:55.864
AT THIS RATE,
I'LL NEVER GET CLOSER TO HIM.

00:15:01.453 --> 00:15:04.539
MAYBE IF I COULD USE
MY SWORD TO DEFLECT THE BULLETS,

00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:06.041
I COULD GET CLOSER.

00:15:06.082 --> 00:15:08.043
THEY'RE FLYING
TOO DAMN FAST, THOUGH.

00:15:10.712 --> 00:15:14.382
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN PREDICT
THE TRAJECTORY OF EACH BULLET.

00:15:24.517 --> 00:15:26.394
NO, I CAN DO THIS.

00:15:26.436 --> 00:15:28.063
THE BULLET LINES TELL ME

00:15:28.104 --> 00:15:30.607
EXACTLY WHAT PATH
THE BULLETS ARE TRAVELING.

00:16:23.993 --> 00:16:25.995
(GRASS RUSTLING)

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.585
(GASPS) NOW!

00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:25.221
Uemaru: HOLY CRAP!

00:17:26.264 --> 00:17:29.184
Kirito: JUST A LITTLE FURTHER.

00:17:45.784 --> 00:17:48.703
Uemaru: (SCREAMING)

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.563
Kirito: (GROANS)
DAMN IT.

00:18:20.944 --> 00:18:22.529
OH, MAN.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.489
(FANFARE PLAYING)

00:18:29.494 --> 00:18:33.665
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE
TO DO THIS FOUR MORE TIMES.

00:18:50.557 --> 00:18:52.684
I WONDER WHERE SINON IS.

00:18:56.312 --> 00:19:00.358
Death Gun:
ARE YOU THE REAL DEAL?

00:19:21.754 --> 00:19:23.506
Kirito: THE REAL DEAL?

00:19:23.548 --> 00:19:25.508
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.385
WHO ARE YOU?

00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:41.149
Death Gun: I SAW YOUR MATCH.

00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:43.484
YOU TOOK HIM OUT WITH A SWORD.

00:19:43.526 --> 00:19:45.153
Kirito: YEAH. SO WHAT?

00:19:45.195 --> 00:19:48.323
IT'S NOT AGAINST THE RULES,
IS IT?

00:19:48.364 --> 00:19:50.950
Death Gun: I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN.

00:19:50.992 --> 00:19:54.495
ARE YOU THE REAL DEAL?

00:19:54.537 --> 00:19:56.122
Kirito: WAIT.

00:19:56.164 --> 00:19:58.333
DOES HE KNOW ME?

00:20:00.793 --> 00:20:02.420
NO WAY.

00:20:02.462 --> 00:20:05.215
WE HAVE MET BEFORE.

00:20:05.256 --> 00:20:08.593
WE'VE BEEN FACE‐TO‐FACE
LIKE THIS,

00:20:08.635 --> 00:20:13.181
BUT WHERE?
WHERE DO I KNOW HIM FROM?

00:20:26.194 --> 00:20:28.071
Death Gun: WITH THAT NAME

00:20:28.112 --> 00:20:30.782
AND YOUR SWORD SKILLS,

00:20:30.823 --> 00:20:34.702
ARE YOU THE REAL DEAL OR WHAT?

00:20:35.787 --> 00:20:37.997
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

00:20:43.836 --> 00:20:46.839
Kirito: IF HE KNOWS ME,
I SHOULD KNOW HIM.

00:20:49.676 --> 00:20:52.011
THAT'S IT.

00:20:52.053 --> 00:20:55.056
HE'S AN S.A.O. SURVIVOR.

00:20:59.978 --> 00:21:01.521
WHO IS HE,

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:04.357
AND WHERE DID WE MEET
IN S.A.O.?

00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:13.449
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
