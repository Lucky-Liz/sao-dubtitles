WEBVTT

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:09.850
Sinon: SO DEATH GUN
WAS IN LAUGHING COFFIN,

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:11.935
AND YOU GUYS FOUGHT BEFORE.

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:20.527
KIRITO,
I NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING.

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:22.571
IT'S ABOUT
THE PEOPLE YOU KILLED.

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:25.031
HOW DID YOU GET OVER
WHAT YOU DID?

00:00:25.073 --> 00:00:27.159
HOW ARE YOU
NOT AFFECTED BY IT?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.120
HOW ARE YOU SO STRONG,
YOU'RE NOT CONTROLLED BY IT?

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.668
Kirito: I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN OVER IT.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.503
Sinon: WHAT?

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:41.798
Kirito: LAST NIGHT,
I KEPT HAVING NIGHTMARES

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.009
ABOUT THE THREE GUYS I KILLED.

00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:45.886
I HARDLY SLEPT AT ALL.

00:00:45.927 --> 00:00:49.556
I SAW THEIR FACES
RIGHT BEFORE THEY VANISHED.

00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:51.808
I HEARD THEIR VOICES,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.977
THEIR WORDS.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.897
I DON'T THINK
I'M EVER GONNA FORGET 'EM.

00:00:56.938 --> 00:00:58.190
Sinon: (GASPS)

00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.400
BUT THEN...

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:02.611
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:04.946
I‐‐I CAN'T...

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.574
Kirito: IT'S OKAY.

00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:11.078
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY
HOW IT SHOULD BE.

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.579
I GET IT NOW.

00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:14.581
THERE ARE THINGS
I SHOULDN'T FORGET,

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:16.374
WHAT IT MEANS TO KILL,

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:18.502
THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF TAKING A LIFE.

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:20.629
AND ONCE I ACCEPT IT,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.632
MAYBE THEN I'LL BE ABLE
TO FIND SOME CLOSURE.

00:01:23.673 --> 00:01:25.592
THAT'S HOW I SEE IT.

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:28.011
Sinon: CLOSURE...

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:29.596
BY ACCEPTING IT?

00:01:29.638 --> 00:01:31.556
(SIGHS)

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.327
(WIND BLOWING)

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:20.750
Sinon: DEATH GUN.

00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:21.709
Kirito: HMM?

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:23.211
Sinon: IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:25.630
THAT UNDER THAT CLOAK,
THERE'S A REAL‐LIVE PERSON

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.298
WHO JUST WANTS TO KILL.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.550
Kirito: YEAH.

00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:30.885
AND IF I KNEW
HIS HANDLE IN S.A.O.,

00:03:30.927 --> 00:03:32.470
I'D BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.597
HIS NAME AND ADDRESS
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:38.893
THAT'S THE REASON
WHY I LOGGED INTO G.G.O.

00:03:39.894 --> 00:03:41.020
Sinon: OH.

00:03:41.062 --> 00:03:43.273
THEN MAYBE
HIS REASON FOR BEING HERE

00:03:43.314 --> 00:03:46.693
IS 'CAUSE HE LIKES TO P.K.
MAYBE HE MISSES THE RUSH

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:49.028
OF DOING IT FROM S.A.O.
YOU THINK?

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.698
Kirito: NAH,
THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.283
HE KILLED XEXEED AND TARAKO

00:03:53.324 --> 00:03:55.535
IN FRONT
OF A BUNCH OF WITNESSES.

00:03:55.577 --> 00:03:57.996
IT WAS THE SAME WITH PALE RIDER.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:02.000
HE ALWAYS PICKS TIMES WHEN HE'S
GOT THE BIGGEST AUDIENCE.

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.461
AND THAT SIGN OF THE CROSS
HE MAKES,

00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:08.465
I BET HE DOES IT TO FREAK OUT
AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

00:04:08.506 --> 00:04:10.008
HE WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.385
HE'S GOT THE POWER TO KILL YOU
FROM IN THE GAME,

00:04:12.427 --> 00:04:13.470
BUT IT'S ALL A SHOW.

00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:14.512
Sinon: IF THAT'S TRUE,

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.347
THEN HOW'S HE KILLING PEOPLE?

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.600
Kirito: IT'S NOT
'CAUSE OF BRAIN DAMAGE

00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:20.518
FROM THEIR HEADGEAR.
THE AUTHORITIES SAID

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.188
THAT XEXEED AND TARAKO
DIED OF HEART FAILURE.

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.065
Sinon: HEART FAILURE?

00:04:26.107 --> 00:04:28.067
MY GOD.

00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:29.736
Kirito: TO BE HONEST,

00:04:29.778 --> 00:04:32.322
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HE KILLED 'EM EITHER.

00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:35.450
BUT THE THOUGHT OF FIRING
A GUN IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD

00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:38.077
AND STOPPING A PLAYER'S HEART,

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:40.121
THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S POSSIBLE.

00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:41.956
HANG ON A SECOND.

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:43.625
COME TO THINK OF IT...

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:44.751
Sinon: WHAT?

00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:46.127
Kirito: THAT WAS WEIRD.

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.212
Sinon: WHAT WAS?

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:49.297
Kirito: BACK THERE IN THE RUINS,

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:51.299
HE HAD HIS HANDGUN OUT FOR YOU,

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:53.635
BUT HE SWITCHED
TO THE RIFLE FOR ME,

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:55.261
BUT HE KILLS WITH THE HANDGUN.

00:04:55.303 --> 00:05:00.099
HE COULD HAVE KILLED ME WITH IT,
SO WHY'D HE SWITCH?

00:05:00.141 --> 00:05:01.601
Sinon: YEAH. GOOD QUESTION.

00:05:10.068 --> 00:05:13.112
Kirito: COULD IT BE
THAT HE DIDN'T SHOOT ME WITH IT

00:05:13.154 --> 00:05:15.114
'CAUSE HE COULDN'T
SHOOT ME WITH IT?

00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:17.867
THE HANDGUN,

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.911
CAN'T USE IT, THOUGH.

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:22.705
THE SWITCH.
THE CROSSING HIMSELF THING.

00:05:22.747 --> 00:05:24.374
INVISIBILITY CLOAK.

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:26.000
CONDITIONS, RULES.

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.670
Kikuoka: HERE.
I CAN'T TELL YOU

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:31.589
HOW RELIEVED I AM
TO HEAR YOU PUT IT INTO WORDS.

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:33.007
Kirito: KNEW IT.

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.886
IN‐GAME GUNS CAN'T KILL I.R.L.

00:05:36.928 --> 00:05:39.889
SHOOTING SOMEONE
FROM IN HERE'S NOT WHAT DOES IT.

00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:41.057
IT TAKES PREPARATION.

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.433
Sinon: NOW YOU LOST ME.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.727
Kirito: THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE IT LOOK

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:46.312
LIKE HE'S KILLING PEOPLE IN‐GAME

00:05:46.354 --> 00:05:49.774
IS BY SETTING UP FOR THE MURDER
IN THE REAL WORLD FIRST.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:52.277
Sinon: HOW WOULD HE
SET SOMETHING LIKE THAT UP?

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:54.153
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE RIGHT,

00:05:54.195 --> 00:05:57.490
HE'D HAVE TO GET A PLAYER'S
REAL‐LIFE INFORMATION TO DO IT.

00:05:57.532 --> 00:05:59.409
ALL THAT STUFF'S SECURE, THOUGH.

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.371
Kirito: NO.
IF SOMEONE'S CLEVER ENOUGH,

00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:05.665
THEY CAN FIND OUT
A PLAYER'S ADDRESS EASY.

00:06:05.707 --> 00:06:07.292
Sinon: HOW?

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:10.378
Kirito: THE TERMINALS
AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.007
YOU HAVE TO PLUG YOUR REAL NAME
AND ADDRESS INTO 'EM TO COMPETE.

00:06:14.048 --> 00:06:15.508
IT'S AN OPEN SPACE.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.219
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY PRIVACY THERE.

00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:21.139
Sinon: NO WAY. YOU SAYING
HE PEEKED OVER THEIR SHOULDERS

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.766
WHILE THEY ENTERED THEIR INFO?
THAT CAN'T BE IT,

00:06:23.808 --> 00:06:26.060
'CAUSE YOU'D NOTICE
SOMEONE LURKING NEXT TO YOU.

00:06:26.102 --> 00:06:27.979
Kirito: HE COULD HAVE
USED A SCOPE

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.939
OR SOME BINOCULARS
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

00:06:29.981 --> 00:06:31.482
Sinon: THAT'S
BREAKING ETIQUETTE.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:34.319
HE'D GET HIS ASS
KICKED OUT OF THE GAME FOR THAT.

00:06:36.613 --> 00:06:38.239
Kirito: THEN HOW 'BOUT THIS?

00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:40.909
MAYBE DEATH GUN CAN,
LIKE, USE HIS CLOAK

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.785
TO TURN INVISIBLE IN TOWN, TOO.

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:45.913
Sinon: HE'D BE RIGHT THERE,

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:47.790
AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

00:06:47.832 --> 00:06:50.960
BUT STILL, HE CAN'T
DO ANYTHING IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:06:51.002 --> 00:06:53.630
WHEN HE'S LOGGED IN HERE,
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS THERE.

00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:54.672
Kirito: RIGHT.

00:06:57.925 --> 00:06:58.885
(GASPS)

00:06:58.926 --> 00:07:00.970
WAIT.

00:07:01.012 --> 00:07:03.222
THAT'S IT. YEAH.

00:07:03.264 --> 00:07:05.058
IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:06.392
DEATH GUN...

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:07.769
HAS A PARTNER!

00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:10.313
CHECK IT OUT.

00:07:10.355 --> 00:07:13.107
ONE OF THEM PLAYS
AS THE DEATH GUN AVATAR.

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:15.068
HIS JOB IS TO SHOOT THE TARGET.

00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:17.445
AT THE SAME TIME,
IN THE REAL WORLD,

00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:19.489
THE SECOND PERSON
IN THE TARGET'S APARTMENT.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.699
HIS JOB IS TAKE THE PLAYER OUT.

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:22.825
Sinon: (GASPS)

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.164
OKAY, BUT LET'S SAY
THEY FOUND OUT YOUR ADDRESS.

00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:30.375
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PEOPLE
LIVING THERE?

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.876
AND THEY'D NEED A KEY.

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:34.337
Kirito: AS FAR
AS XEXEED AND TARAKO GO,

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:35.880
THEY LIVED ALONE,

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:39.092
AND THEIR APARTMENTS
WERE IN OLDER BUILDINGS.

00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:41.761
THE E‐LOCKS ON THEIR DOORS
WERE PROBABLY FIRST‐GEN,

00:07:41.803 --> 00:07:43.471
NOT VERY SECURE.

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:47.308
BESIDES, THEY WERE BOTH DIVING
IN G.G.O. DURING THE BREAK‐IN,

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.977
SO THEY WERE BOTH UNCONSCIOUS
AND COMPLETELY HELPLESS.

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:51.562
THEY COULDN'T HEAR,

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:54.774
SO THE KILLER COULD
TAKE HIS TIME GETTING IN.

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:56.484
Sinon: BUT THEN YOU SAID

00:07:56.526 --> 00:07:59.112
THE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR BOTH
WAS HEART FAILURE, RIGHT?

00:07:59.153 --> 00:08:00.863
SO HOW'D THEY
STOP SOMEONE'S HEART

00:08:00.905 --> 00:08:03.991
IN A WAY BOTH THE COPS AND
THE CORONER COULDN'T FIGURE OUT?

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:07.078
Kirito: MAYBE BY INJECTING
SOME KIND OF DRUG OR SOMETHING.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.079
THAT'S ONE WAY.

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.539
Sinon: OKAY, BUT SOMEONE

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.541
SHOULD HAVE FOUND
EVIDENCE OF IT,

00:08:11.582 --> 00:08:13.000
A MARK OR SOMETHING.

00:08:13.042 --> 00:08:16.003
Kirito: THEY DIDN'T
FIND THE BODIES FOR A WHILE,

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:17.755
SO THEY WERE PRETTY DECOMPOSED.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.257
BESIDES, A HARD‐CORE GAMER

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:21.926
CAN GO FOR DAYS
WITHOUT EATING OR SLEEPING.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:24.178
I DOUBT ANYONE
WOULD THINK IT'S WEIRD

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.432
IF SOMEONE DIED
OF A HEART ATTACK AFTER THAT.

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:29.308
Sinon: THEY'RE CRAZY.

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:31.477
RIGHT?

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:33.896
I MEAN, WHY ELSE
WOULD ANYONE DO THIS?

00:08:33.938 --> 00:08:37.275
Kirito: MAYBE,
OR MAYBE THEY DO IT

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:40.903
'CAUSE RED PLAYERS
ARE WHO THEY REALLY ARE.

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:44.282
I MEAN, DEEP DOWN,
I THINK I'M REALLY A SWORDSMAN.

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:48.202
Sinon: WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,
I CAN SORT OF UNDERSTAND.

00:08:48.244 --> 00:08:53.666
THERE'S TIMES WHEN I THINK
I'M A REAL SNIPER, NOT A GAMER.

00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:55.752
WAIT. DO YOU THINK

00:08:55.793 --> 00:08:58.755
THE GUY DOING THE KILLING'S
A RED PLAYER, TOO,

00:08:58.796 --> 00:09:00.631
YOU KNOW, LIKE DEATH GUN?

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:04.093
Kirito: YEAH. THEY WERE PROBABLY
IN LAUGHING COFFIN TOGETHER.

00:09:04.135 --> 00:09:07.305
I'M STILL WONDERING HOW THEY
COORDINATED THE KILLINGS

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:09.640
BETWEEN THIS WORLD
AND THE REAL ONE.

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:12.060
HOW ARE THEY
SO PRECISE ABOUT IT?

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:13.561
‐ YEAH.
‐ Sinon: (GASPS)

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:15.104
Kirito: THAT'S IT.

00:09:15.146 --> 00:09:17.815
THAT'S WHAT DOING
THE SIGN OF THE CROSS IS ABOUT.

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.609
IT'S NOT JUST FOR SHOW.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.738
IT'S ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO SNEAK A PEEK AT HIS WATCH.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.615
Sinon: YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:30.078
(GASPS)

00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:32.246
Kirito: SINON...

00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:33.581
DO YOU LIVE ALONE?

00:09:33.623 --> 00:09:35.416
Sinon: UM, YEAH.

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:37.752
BUT I'M SURE I LOCKED MY DOOR.

00:09:39.003 --> 00:09:40.838
MY BUILDING'S
GOT FIRST‐GEN LOCKS,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.508
BUT I'VE ALSO GOT A CHAIN.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:44.675
(GASPS)

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:47.345
I THINK I LEFT
THE CHAIN OFF TONIGHT.

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:49.097
Kirito: OH, MAN.

00:09:51.598 --> 00:09:54.684
LISTEN,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE THIS.

00:09:57.187 --> 00:10:00.232
WHEN DEATH GUN
WAS CHASING US ON THAT HORSE,

00:10:00.273 --> 00:10:02.567
I WASN'T THE ONE
HE WAS SHOOTING AT.

00:10:02.609 --> 00:10:04.111
AND THAT COULD ONLY MEAN

00:10:04.152 --> 00:10:06.947
THEY GOT THEIR NEXT VICTIM
ALL SET UP AND READY TO GO.

00:10:06.988 --> 00:10:08.698
Sinon: OKAY.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.534
THEN WHO'S NEXT?

00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:14.704
Kirito: I GOT A FEELING THAT
RIGHT NOW IN THE REAL WORLD,

00:10:14.746 --> 00:10:17.207
DEATH GUN'S PARTNER'S
IN YOUR PLACE.

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.875
HE'S WATCHING THE LIVE STREAM,

00:10:18.917 --> 00:10:21.628
WAITING FOR WHEN YOU
GET SHOT BY THAT GUN.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.255
IT'S JUST A HUNCH.

00:10:25.507 --> 00:10:26.842
(LIZARD SQUEALS)

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.629
Sinon: NO.

00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:05.090
NO, NOT THAT.

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:07.842
OH, GOD. (GASPING)

00:11:09.594 --> 00:11:11.596
(HEART BEATING)

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.274
Kirito: CALM DOWN.

00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:24.485
IF YOU LOG OUT NOW,
YOU'LL BE IN DANGER.

00:11:24.527 --> 00:11:26.404
JUST CALM DOWN.

00:11:26.445 --> 00:11:28.197
GO EASY.

00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:30.700
(HEARTBEAT SLOWING)

00:11:37.832 --> 00:11:39.834
UNTIL DEATH GUN SHOOTS YOU,

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:43.295
THE GUY IN YOUR PLACE
ISN'T GONNA DO ANYTHING, OKAY?

00:11:43.337 --> 00:11:45.965
THAT'S THE RULE
THEY SET UP FOR THEMSELVES.

00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:50.302
BUT IF YOU LOG OUT NOW AND
WAKE UP WITH HIS PARTNER THERE,

00:11:50.344 --> 00:11:53.639
HE'LL KILL YOU,
SO YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN.

00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:55.766
Sinon: BUT‐‐BUT...

00:11:55.808 --> 00:11:58.394
I'M SCARED. I'M SO SCARED.

00:12:03.107 --> 00:12:05.234
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:06.277
All: HMM?

00:12:08.154 --> 00:12:10.906
Lisbeth: JEEZ, CHRYSHEIGHT,

00:12:10.948 --> 00:12:13.367
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

00:12:13.409 --> 00:12:15.786
Chrysheight: SORRY, GUYS.
I BOOKED IT OVER HERE

00:12:15.828 --> 00:12:18.205
AS FAST AS I COULD
FROM MY SAVE POINT.

00:12:18.247 --> 00:12:20.249
IF THERE WERE
A SPEED LIMIT IN A.L.O.,

00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:23.210
MY LICENSE WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN SUSPENDED.

00:12:23.252 --> 00:12:24.253
HUH?

00:12:27.006 --> 00:12:28.507
Asuna: WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:12:32.094 --> 00:12:33.637
Chrysheight: (CLEARS THROAT)

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:35.639
I'D BE HAPPY
TO EXPLAIN IN DETAIL,

00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:38.517
BUT I SHOULD WARN YOU
IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE.

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:41.604
TO TELL THE TRUTH, I'M NOT
100% SURE WHERE TO BEGIN.

00:12:41.645 --> 00:12:42.730
Asuna: OH, DON'T EVEN.

00:12:42.772 --> 00:12:43.939
Yui: NOT TO WORRY.

00:12:43.981 --> 00:12:46.066
I KNOW JUST WHERE TO START.

00:12:46.108 --> 00:12:48.778
ON NOVEMBER 9,
IN GUN GALE ONLINE,

00:12:48.819 --> 00:12:51.363
A PLAYER CALLED DEATH GUN
FIRED HIS WEAPON

00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:53.449
AT AN AVATAR
APPEARING ON A MONITOR.

00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:56.744
THAT SAME DAY IN NAKANO WARD,

00:12:56.786 --> 00:12:59.580
THE PLAYER OF THAT AVATAR
MYSTERIOUSLY DIED.

00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:07.379
Chrysheight: YOUNG LADY,
THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:10.299
GATHERING ALL THAT INFORMATION
AND CONNECTING IT SO QUICKLY,

00:13:10.341 --> 00:13:12.134
YOU MUST BE
QUITE THE RESEARCHER.

00:13:12.176 --> 00:13:15.304
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
A CAREER IN THE V. R. SECTION?

00:13:15.346 --> 00:13:16.972
‐ Asuna: (GROANS)
‐ Chrysheight: WHOA. YOU WIN.

00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:19.975
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT GOING
TO STONEWALL YOU, PROMISE.

00:13:20.017 --> 00:13:21.977
JUST COMPLIMENTING HER, IS ALL.

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:24.730
SHE'S RIGHT, THOUGH. IT'S TRUE.

00:13:24.772 --> 00:13:26.398
Klein: YO,
CHRYSHEIGHT OR WHATEVER,

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.317
I HEAR YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT HIRED KIRITO

00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:29.902
TO DIVE INTO THAT GAME.

00:13:29.944 --> 00:13:32.738
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU GOT HIM TO CONVERT OVER

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.782
KNOWING A PLAYER
GOT SHOT IN‐GAME

00:13:34.823 --> 00:13:36.325
AND DIED I.R.L. BECAUSE OF IT?

00:13:36.367 --> 00:13:38.077
Chrysheight: EASY, KLEIN.
I CAN EXPLAIN.

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:39.828
THAT'S NOT HOW THE PLAYER DIED.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.539
Klein: THEN HOW?

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.249
Chrysheight: IT'S NOT
THE AMUSPHERE RIG.

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:47.461
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU
IN‐GAME, IT CAN'T HURT YOU,

00:13:47.502 --> 00:13:49.588
AND IT CERTAINLY
CAN'T STOP A PLAYER'S HEART

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.590
WHEN IT'S NOT EVEN
DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO IT.

00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:54.342
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
KIRITO AND I MET LAST WEEK

00:13:54.384 --> 00:13:57.095
TO TALK ABOUT IT AND PRETTY MUCH
AGREED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:13:57.137 --> 00:14:00.307
THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE
CAN KILL A PERSON IN REAL LIFE

00:14:00.348 --> 00:14:02.059
BY SHOOTING THEM IN THE GAME.

00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:07.064
Leafa: OKAY, THEN,
IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE,

00:14:07.105 --> 00:14:10.400
HOW COME YOU HAD MY BROTHER
DIVE INTO G.G.O. FOR YOU, HUH?

00:14:10.442 --> 00:14:12.736
YOU HAD A HUNCH
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

00:14:12.778 --> 00:14:13.862
SCRATCH THAT.

00:14:13.904 --> 00:14:15.739
YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG.

00:14:15.781 --> 00:14:17.616
THAT DEATH GUN GUY'S
A PART OF IT,

00:14:17.657 --> 00:14:20.744
AND I BET YOU SENT MY BROTHER IN
TO TRY TO FIND HIM.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.705
Asuna: CHRYSHEIGHT,

00:14:23.747 --> 00:14:25.207
WE FIGURED IT OUT.

00:14:25.248 --> 00:14:28.168
DEATH GUN IS AN S.A.O.
SURVIVOR JUST LIKE US,

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.629
BUT UNLIKE US,
HE WAS A RED PLAYER

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.298
WHO WAS IN A GUILD OF KILLERS
CALLED LAUGHING COFFIN.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.759
Chrysheight: YOU SURE
HE WAS WITH THEM?

00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:39.012
Asuna: YES. NONE OF US
CAN REMEMBER HIS NAME, THOUGH.

00:14:39.054 --> 00:14:40.931
KLEIN AND I MET HIM ONCE

00:14:40.972 --> 00:14:43.225
WHEN OUR GROUP
WENT TO CAPTURE HIS.

00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:46.103
Lisbeth: UM, HEY, ASUNA,
I GET THE FEELING

00:14:46.144 --> 00:14:48.438
CHRYSHEIGHT KNOWS MORE
THAN HE'S LETTING ON.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.524
NO OFFENSE, CHRYSHEIGHT,
BUT ALL WE KNOW

00:14:50.565 --> 00:14:53.527
IS YOU WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT
DOING SOMETHING WITH NETWORKS

00:14:53.568 --> 00:14:55.278
AND THAT YOU PLAY A.L.O.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.949
AS PART OF SOME KIND OF RESEARCH
YOU'RE DOING ON V.R.M.M.O.s.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.951
Chrysheight: ONLY FOR THE PAST YEAR.

00:15:00.992 --> 00:15:03.620
THE JOB I HAD BEFORE
WAS A LITTLE...

00:15:03.662 --> 00:15:04.788
DIFFERENT.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.582
I USED TO BE PART
OF THE TASK FORCE

00:15:07.624 --> 00:15:08.917
FOR THE S.A.O. INCIDENT.

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:12.462
BUT EVEN THOUGH
WE WERE CALLED A TASK FORCE,

00:15:12.504 --> 00:15:14.798
IN THE END,
WE WERE PRETTY INEFFECTIVE.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.176
Asuna: CHRYSHEIGHT,
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY WELL CONNECTED,

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:20.428
AND WITH A LITTLE DIGGING,
YOU COULD FIND OUT

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.181
WHAT THE REAL‐LIFE NAME AND
ADDRESS OF THIS DEATH GUN IS.

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:25.225
JUST MAKE A LIST OF THE HANDLES

00:15:25.267 --> 00:15:27.269
OF ALL THE SURVIVING
LAUGHING COFFIN MEMBERS.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.479
THEN CONTACT THEIR I.S.P.s,

00:15:29.521 --> 00:15:31.690
ASK WHICH ONE'S
PLAYING G.G.O. NOW,

00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:33.275
AND TRACE THEIR LOCATION.

00:15:33.316 --> 00:15:35.110
Chrysheight: NO. SORRY,
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

00:15:35.152 --> 00:15:36.820
THE I.S.P.s
AREN'T GOING TO GIVE OUT

00:15:36.862 --> 00:15:38.113
A PLAYER'S REAL‐LIFE INFO

00:15:38.155 --> 00:15:40.615
IF ALL WE HAVE TO GO ON
ARE THEIR HANDLES.

00:15:40.657 --> 00:15:42.784
Silica: MAYBE IF WE ASK
THE GAME'S ADMINS,

00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:43.785
THEY COULD HELP.

00:15:43.827 --> 00:15:44.578
Chrysheight: THEY MIGHT,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.497
BUT G.G.O.'s ADMINS
ARE IN THE U. S.,

00:15:46.538 --> 00:15:48.582
SO IT'LL BE A WHILE
BEFORE WE GOT AN ANSWER.

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:51.585
Leafa: I KNOW MY BROTHER,

00:15:51.627 --> 00:15:54.922
AND RIGHT NOW, HE'S RISKING
HIS LIFE IN THAT GAME,

00:15:54.963 --> 00:15:57.591
TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHO THIS PERSON IS.

00:15:57.633 --> 00:16:01.220
WHEN HE CAME HOME LAST NIGHT,
HE HAD THIS LOOK ON HIS FACE,

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:02.930
LIKE HE'D SEEN A GHOST.

00:16:02.971 --> 00:16:06.100
HE MUST HAVE BUMPED INTO THE GUY
YESTERDAY DURING THE PRELIMS.

00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:08.977
I BET THAT'S WHEN HE REALIZED

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:12.147
SOMEONE FROM LAUGHING COFFIN
WAS IN G.G.O.,

00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:16.151
SOMEONE WHO FIGURED OUT HOW
TO KILL PLAYERS FOR REAL AGAIN.

00:16:16.193 --> 00:16:19.487
MY BROTHER WENT BACK
TO PUT AN END TO THAT NIGHTMARE,

00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:23.867
TO FIND OUT HIS NAME, AND STOP
HIS P.K.ING ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:16:23.909 --> 00:16:26.369
Asuna: (THINKING)
DARN IT, KIRITO.

00:16:26.411 --> 00:16:28.371
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

00:16:28.413 --> 00:16:31.666
WHY? WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DO THIS?

00:16:31.708 --> 00:16:33.376
Kirito: THAT DAMN IDIOT!

00:16:33.418 --> 00:16:35.003
WHY DIDN'T HE SAY ANYTHING?

00:16:35.045 --> 00:16:37.172
I COULD BE
BACKING HIM UP RIGHT NOW,

00:16:37.214 --> 00:16:40.342
ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS ASK, AND I
WOULD HAVE CONVERTED OVER, TOO.

00:16:40.383 --> 00:16:41.927
Silica: WE ALL WOULD HAVE.

00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:44.512
DON'T YOU SEE?
THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T TELL US.

00:16:44.554 --> 00:16:47.974
IF HE THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY REAL
DANGER IN WHAT HE WAS DOING,

00:16:48.016 --> 00:16:50.810
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'D GET US MIXED UP IN IT, TOO.

00:16:50.852 --> 00:16:52.187
THAT'S JUST HOW HE IS.

00:16:52.229 --> 00:16:53.480
Lisbeth: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:16:53.521 --> 00:16:55.815
HE ALWAYS THINKS OF OTHERS
BEFORE HIMSELF.

00:16:55.857 --> 00:16:58.151
IN FACT, HE'S PROBABLY
PROTECTING SOMEONE RIGHT NOW,

00:16:58.193 --> 00:16:59.694
AND WHOEVER THAT IS,

00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:02.197
I BET IT'S SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T LIKE HIM MUCH.

00:17:06.952 --> 00:17:09.955
Asuna: OKAY, CHRYSHEIGHT,
WHERE IS KIRITO DIVING FROM?

00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:12.874
I KNOW YOU KNOW,
SO YOU BETTER TELL ME NOW.

00:17:12.916 --> 00:17:14.167
Chrysheight: MM...

00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:17.128
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.673
EH, OKAY, OKAY. I'LL TELL YOU.

00:17:19.714 --> 00:17:22.259
I SET UP THE ROOM MYSELF,
SO HE'S SAFE.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.593
SECURITY'S ROCK‐SOLID,

00:17:23.635 --> 00:17:25.929
AND THE MONITORING'S
TOP OF THE LINE.

00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:29.057
I'VE GOT A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL
RIGHT BY HIS SIDE AT ALL TIMES,

00:17:29.099 --> 00:17:31.643
AND I GUARANTEE THAT HIS BODY'S
IN NO DANGER WHATSOEVER.

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:32.852
Asuna: WHERE IS HE?!

00:17:32.894 --> 00:17:34.604
Chrysheight: A HOSPITAL.

00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:36.606
IT'S IN OCHANOMIZU
IN CHIYODA WARD.

00:17:36.648 --> 00:17:38.608
Asuna: HE'S IN CHIYODA?

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.694
WAIT. IS THAT THE SAME HOSPITAL

00:17:40.735 --> 00:17:42.696
HE WAS IN
DURING HIS REHABILITATION?

00:17:42.737 --> 00:17:44.281
Chrysheight: YES, THAT'S THE ONE.

00:17:44.322 --> 00:17:46.616
Asuna: I'M GOING OVER THERE.
I WANT TO SEE HIM,

00:17:46.658 --> 00:17:48.493
AND YOU CAN'T DO
A THING ABOUT IT.

00:17:55.502 --> 00:17:57.796
Sinon: TELL ME YOU GOT A PLAN.

00:17:57.837 --> 00:18:00.590
Kirito: WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE OUT DEATH GUN.

00:18:00.632 --> 00:18:02.175
ONCE WE DO,

00:18:02.217 --> 00:18:04.636
HIS REAL WORLD PARTNER'LL
STAND DOWN.

00:18:04.677 --> 00:18:06.679
THEN HE'LL JUST LEAVE
YOUR APARTMENT.

00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:09.349
Sinon: OKAY, BUT HE'S SKILLED,

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.601
BLACK STAR OR NO BLACK STAR.

00:18:11.643 --> 00:18:14.270
YOU SAW.
HE DODGED HECATE'S BULLET

00:18:14.312 --> 00:18:17.482
FROM JUST 100 METERS AWAY.

00:18:17.524 --> 00:18:21.569
AND BESIDES, I CAN'T HIDE
IN THIS CAVE FOREVER, YOU KNOW.

00:18:21.611 --> 00:18:22.987
BY NOW, THE OTHER PLAYERS

00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:25.532
PROBABLY FIGURED OUT
THE TWO OF US ARE IN HERE.

00:18:25.573 --> 00:18:27.450
WE MIGHT AS WELL
BE SITTING DUCKS.

00:18:27.492 --> 00:18:29.327
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME

00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:31.121
BEFORE SOMEONE
TOSSES A GRENADE IN.

00:18:31.162 --> 00:18:32.747
Kirito: YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:35.667
Sinon: WE'VE BEEN A TEAM
THIS WHOLE TIME ANYWAY, RIGHT?

00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:37.627
MIGHT AS WELL
FINISH IT TOGETHER.

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:39.254
Kirito: OKAY,

00:18:39.295 --> 00:18:42.382
BUT THERE'S STILL THE RISK
HE SHOOTS YOU WITH THAT GUN.

00:18:42.423 --> 00:18:43.842
Sinon: OH, THAT THING.

00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:46.177
IT'S JUST AN OLD‐SCHOOL
SINGLE‐ACTION SIDEARM.

00:18:46.219 --> 00:18:49.639
HE CAN FIRE IT ALL HE WANTS,
BUT I GOT YOU THERE.

00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:51.641
JUST DEFLECT THE BULLETS
WITH YOUR SWORD.

00:18:51.683 --> 00:18:54.794
Kirito: RIGHT, AND I WON'T LET
A SINGLE ONE OF 'EM HIT YOU.

00:18:54.798 --> 00:18:56.008
I STILL DON'T FEEL GOOD

00:18:56.049 --> 00:18:57.647
ABOUT YOU BEING
OUT THERE, THOUGH.

00:18:57.647 --> 00:18:58.940
I MEAN, DEATH GUN'S DANGEROUS,

00:18:58.982 --> 00:19:01.067
AND YOU SHOULDN'T GET
TOO CLOSE TO HIM.

00:19:01.109 --> 00:19:02.402
Sinon: OH, COME ON.

00:19:02.443 --> 00:19:04.237
Kirito: HANG ON.
I'M TOTALLY COOL

00:19:04.279 --> 00:19:07.907
WITH YOU FIGHTING WITH ME, AND I
WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY,

00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:10.201
BUT, SINON,
YOU'RE A SNIPER, REMEMBER?

00:19:10.243 --> 00:19:12.912
ISN'T YOUR SPECIALTY
THE LONG‐RANGE ATTACK?

00:19:12.954 --> 00:19:14.831
Sinon: WELL, YEAH.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

00:19:14.872 --> 00:19:16.124
Kirito: HERE'S THE PLAN.

00:19:16.165 --> 00:19:17.458
ON THE NEXT SCAN,

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.669
I'M GONNA STEP OUTSIDE
SO IT PICKS ME UP.

00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:22.463
THAT WAY, WE'LL GET
DEATH GUN TO COME TO US.

00:19:22.505 --> 00:19:24.674
HE'LL PROBABLY KEEP HIS DISTANCE
AND TAKE COVER.

00:19:24.716 --> 00:19:27.302
THEN HE'LL TRY TO PICK ME OFF
WITH HIS RIFLE.

00:19:27.343 --> 00:19:29.262
WHEN HE SHOOTS,
WE'LL KNOW WHERE HE IS,

00:19:29.304 --> 00:19:30.763
AND THEN YOU TAKE HIM OUT.

00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:32.098
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.309
Sinon: ARE YOU COOL
WITH PLAYING THE DECOY?

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.810
Kirito: MM‐HMM.

00:19:35.852 --> 00:19:38.521
Sinon: ALL RIGHT.
WE DO IT YOUR WAY THEN.

00:19:38.563 --> 00:19:40.106
JUST BE CAREFUL OUT THERE,

00:19:40.148 --> 00:19:41.941
'CAUSE IF HE DROPS YOU
WITH HIS FIRST SHOT,

00:19:41.983 --> 00:19:43.443
I'M GONNA BE PISSED.

00:19:43.484 --> 00:19:45.903
Kirito: HEH.
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

00:19:45.945 --> 00:19:47.697
WAIT. I JUST REMEMBERED.

00:19:47.739 --> 00:19:50.158
HIS RIFLE'S GOT A SILENCER,
AND YOU WON'T SEE

00:19:50.199 --> 00:19:52.035
THE BULLET LINE
ON THE FIRST SHOT.

00:19:52.076 --> 00:19:54.370
Sinon: OH, I'LL JUST PREDICT
THE PREDICTION,

00:19:54.412 --> 00:19:56.998
YOU KNOW, LIKE A CERTAIN
NO‐GOOD FAKER TOLD‐‐

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.585
Kirito: UM, I THINK
WE SHOULD STOP TALKING.

00:20:00.627 --> 00:20:01.669
Sinon: UH...

00:20:04.464 --> 00:20:06.007
UGH. OH, CRAP.

00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:08.176
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PAYING MORE ATTENTION.

00:20:08.217 --> 00:20:09.761
Kirito: WHAT IS IT?

00:20:09.802 --> 00:20:11.804
AND WILL IT KILL US?

00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:13.598
Sinon:
IT'S A LIVE‐STREAM CAMERA.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.642
USUALLY THEY'RE
ONLY SUPPOSED TO SHADOW

00:20:15.683 --> 00:20:16.934
PLAYERS ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

00:20:16.976 --> 00:20:18.978
I GUESS THIS ONE'S
IN HERE NOW

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.938
'CAUSE THERE AREN'T
MANY OF US LEFT OUT THERE.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.690
Kirito: THEN DO YOU...

00:20:22.732 --> 00:20:24.025
THINK IT HEARD US?

00:20:24.067 --> 00:20:26.235
Sinon: NOT A CHANCE.
FOR IT TO PICK US UP,

00:20:26.277 --> 00:20:28.696
WE'D HAVE TO BE SHOUTING
AT THE TOP OF OUR LUNGS.

00:20:29.238 --> 00:20:31.157
WAVE TO THE AUDIENCE.

00:20:31.198 --> 00:20:33.868
UNLESS YOU GOT
SOMEONE BACK AT HOME

00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:35.536
YOU DON'T WANT SEEING THIS.

00:20:35.578 --> 00:20:36.745
Kirito: (GRUNTS)

00:20:36.787 --> 00:20:39.540
UH, I, UM...

00:20:39.582 --> 00:20:41.626
SHOULDN'T YOU BE WORRIED
WHO'S WATCHING?

00:20:41.668 --> 00:20:43.545
I MEAN, SINCE I SORT OF
LOOK LIKE A GIRL,

00:20:43.587 --> 00:20:45.963
THEY MIGHT, YOU KNOW,
THINK YOU'RE, YOU KNOW.

00:20:46.005 --> 00:20:48.883
Sinon: I DON'T CARE.
THEY CAN THINK WHAT THEY WANT.

00:20:48.925 --> 00:20:52.136
THE GUYS IN THIS GAME ARE DORKS.
IF THEY THINK I'M GAY,

00:20:52.178 --> 00:20:54.597
AT LEAST THEY'LL STOP HITTING
ON ME EVERY FIVE SECONDS.

00:20:54.639 --> 00:20:56.015
Kirito: HOW MUCH LONGER

00:20:56.057 --> 00:20:58.267
AM I GONNA HAVE TO KEEP
PRETENDING TO BE A GIRL?

00:20:58.309 --> 00:20:59.936
Sinon: OH, YOU POOR BABY.

00:20:59.977 --> 00:21:02.772
YOU'VE BEEN FAKING IT LIKE
A CHAMP SINCE YOU LOGGED IN.

00:21:02.814 --> 00:21:05.066
ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO
WON'T MATTER.

00:21:05.108 --> 00:21:06.609
THANK GOD.

00:21:06.651 --> 00:21:08.653
(SIGHS)

00:21:08.695 --> 00:21:10.822
WE BETTER GET READY.

00:21:10.863 --> 00:21:13.741
WE GOT TWO MINUTES
BEFORE THE NEXT SAT SCAN.

00:21:13.783 --> 00:21:15.076
I'LL SET UP HERE.

00:21:15.118 --> 00:21:17.620
WHEN YOU GET OUTSIDE,
FIRE UP YOUR TERMINAL,

00:21:17.662 --> 00:21:20.331
AND LET ME KNOW
WHEN OUR BOY'S CLOSE.

00:21:24.376 --> 00:21:26.253
Kirito: WAIT. HOLD ON.

00:21:26.295 --> 00:21:27.713
Sinon: WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

00:21:27.755 --> 00:21:30.382
IT'S TOO LATE
TO CHANGE THE PLAN NOW.

00:21:30.424 --> 00:21:33.052
Kirito: NO, I DON'T WANT
TO CHANGE ANYTHING.

00:21:33.093 --> 00:21:34.720
IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:38.057
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
DEATH GUN'S REAL HANDLE HERE.

00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:39.850
THE ONLY NAME
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE

00:21:39.892 --> 00:21:41.518
WHO'S STILL ALIVE IS STERBEN.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.811
Sinon: OH. HUH.

00:21:42.853 --> 00:21:44.480
I GUESS THAT'S HIM THEN.

00:21:44.521 --> 00:21:47.691
I WONDER WHY HE GAVE HIMSELF
THAT NAME, THOUGH.

00:21:47.733 --> 00:21:49.652
Kirito: IF I GET
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL,

00:21:49.693 --> 00:21:51.654
I'LL BE SURE TO ASK HIM FOR YOU.

00:21:54.198 --> 00:21:56.242
WELL, HERE GOES NOTHING.

00:21:58.285 --> 00:21:59.870
Sinon: BE CAREFUL, OKAY?
