WEBVTT

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.562
(GUNSHOT)

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.815
(GUNSHOT)

00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:09.984
(RIFLE CLICKS)

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:13.029
(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:16.657
Monster: (SHRIEKING)

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:53.778
(HEART BEATING)

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:25.726
Sinon: (PANTING)

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:47.582
ULTIMA RATIO HECATE TWO.

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.669
HECATE.

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:55.459
Player: (GRUNTS) YO, DYNE!

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.294
YOU SURE YOU GOT
THE RIGHT INFO?

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:59.255
ARE THEY COMIN', OR WHAT?

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:01.215
Dyne: THEY'RE COMIN',
ALL RIGHT.

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:04.343
I CHECKED THE ROUTE MYSELF,
SO RELAX.

00:04:06.554 --> 00:04:10.099
I BET THEY'RE BUSY CLEARING
SOME BIG‐ASS MONSTER SPAWN.

00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:12.393
THAT MEANS YOUR CUT'LL
BE BIGGER THIS TIME,

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:14.020
SO NO COMPLAINING.

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:15.438
Player: DUDE,
NO ONE'S COMPLAININ'!

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:16.939
BUT SINCE WE'RE
TALKIN' ABOUT IT,

00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:19.400
AIN'T THESE THE SAME
JOKERS WE HIT LAST WEEK?

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:22.486
THEY COULDA WISED UP TO US
AND CHANGED THEIR ROUTE.

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.655
Dyne: ALL THAT SQUAD DOES
IS HUNT MONSTERS.

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:26.657
THEY DON'T CARE HOW MANY
TIMES THEY GET ATTACKED,

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.452
'CAUSE THEY'LL JUST MAKE UP
FOR IT ON THEIR NEXT HUNT.

00:04:29.493 --> 00:04:31.162
FOR PLAYER‐HUNTER
SQUADS LIKE US,

00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:32.913
THEY MAKE THE PERFECT TARGET.

00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:36.292
THEY MOVE BY ALGORITHM,
JUST LIKE THE MONSTERS.

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:38.127
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THEY'RE CHUMPS.

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.879
Player #2:
DAMN STRAIGHT.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.714
Dyne: AS FOR WEAPONS,
THEY'RE GEARED UP

00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:43.883
WITH OPTICAL GUNS
FOR HUNTING MONSTERS.

00:04:43.924 --> 00:04:46.385
BUT WE'VE GOT DEFENSE SHIELDS,
SO AS LONG AS THOSE'RE UP,

00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:48.262
IT'S EASY PICKINGS.

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:49.764
Player 1: WELL, WHAT IF
THEY GOT SMART?

00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:51.974
LIKE, WHAT IF THEY'RE
READY FOR US THIS TIME?

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:54.060
Dyne: WE HIT 'EM NOT
TOO LONG AGO, RIGHT?

00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:57.396
I DOUBT THEY GOT THEIR HANDS ON
ENOUGH LIVE‐AMMO GUNS THAT FAST.

00:04:57.438 --> 00:04:59.607
BY NOW, THEY MIGHT HAVE
ONE FIREARM FOR SUPPORT,

00:04:59.648 --> 00:05:00.941
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

00:05:00.983 --> 00:05:02.610
AND BESIDES...

00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:05.780
WE GOT THE BEST SNIPER
IN G.G.O. WATCHIN' OUR BACKS.

00:05:13.788 --> 00:05:15.831
WE'VE GOT ALL
OUR BASES COVERED.

00:05:15.873 --> 00:05:18.000
RIGHT, SINON?

00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:19.627
Sinon: YEP.

00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:21.003
Dyne: (SIGHS)

00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:22.546
Player #1: GUESS I CAN'T
ARGUE WITH THAT.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.173
WITH A CRACK SHOT
LIKE SINON UP HERE,

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:25.549
THINGS'RE LOOKIN' GOO‐OOD!

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:26.842
Dyne: (CLEARING THROAT)

00:05:26.884 --> 00:05:28.469
IT'S BETTER THAN GOOD.

00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:31.639
Player #1: WELL, "IF"‐‐
IT'S A BIG "IF," BUT STILL.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.475
IF SHE MISSED,
I'D BE COOL WITH THAT.

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:35.893
IT'LL TAKE THEM ABOUT A MINUTE

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.853
TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE THE SHOT CAME FROM.

00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:39.021
WHILE THEY'RE DOIN' THAT,

00:05:39.063 --> 00:05:40.523
I'LL BE IN POSITION.

00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:43.192
I'LL HOSE 'EM DOWN
AND RAKE IN THE MON‐EY.

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:46.904
Dyne:
EASY, COWBOY.

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:49.323
Ginrou: HEYA, DOLLFACE.
I WAS WONDERIN'.

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:50.825
WHAT YOU DOIN' AFTER THIS?

00:05:50.866 --> 00:05:53.494
I FOUND A GUN SHOP WITH
AN AWESOME INVENTORY.

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:57.415
MAYBE WE COULD GO GET SOME TEA
OR MAYBE DO SOMETHIN' ELSE!

00:05:57.456 --> 00:05:59.500
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:06:00.668 --> 00:06:02.086
(CHUCKLES)

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:04.380
Sinon: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN, GINROU.

00:06:04.422 --> 00:06:07.091
BESIDES, THERE'S STUFF I
HAVE TO DO WHEN I LOG OUT.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.635
Ginrou: AH, COME ON, DOLLFACE!
WHAT "STUFF"?!

00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:11.470
WAIT. ARE YOU
STILL IN SCHOOL?

00:06:11.512 --> 00:06:12.680
THAT'S KINDA HOT.

00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:14.306
YOU GOT A REPORT DUE?!

00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:16.142
Sinon: YEAH. RIGHT.

00:06:16.183 --> 00:06:17.393
Player #2:
LAY OFF HER, GINROU.

00:06:17.435 --> 00:06:19.437
DON'T PUT HER ON
THE SPOT LIKE THAT.

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:21.939
WE'RE WORKIN', SO DON'T
BRING UP THE REAL WORLD IN HERE.

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.691
Player #3: YEAH, MAN!

00:06:23.732 --> 00:06:26.402
THIS AIN'T THE TIME OR PLACE
TO RE‐SPEC YOUR SOLO STATUS!

00:06:26.444 --> 00:06:28.028
Ginrou: LIKE YOU GUYS CAN TALK!

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.448
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
EITHER OF YOU GOT LUCKY?!

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:32.533
Player #3: (LAUGHING)
LAST NIGHT! WITH YOUR SISTER!

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:33.951
Sinon: (SIGHS)

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.536
Dyne: KNOCK IT OFF.
STAY SHARP.

00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:36.579
Player #4: GOT 'EM.

00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:42.251
Dyne: 'BOUT TIME
THEY SHOWED UP TO THE PARTY.

00:06:46.213 --> 00:06:48.299
YUP. IT'S THEM.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.844
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:53.846
THAT'S ONE MORE
THAN LAST WEEK.

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:06.317
WE GOT FOUR OPTICAL BLASTERS
IN THE FRONT.

00:07:07.484 --> 00:07:10.654
I SEE ONE LARGE CALIBER
LASER RIFLE.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:15.326
NOT A PROBLEM.
AND A GUY WITH A MINIMI.

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:17.119
HE GOES DOWN FIRST.

00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:22.082
THE NEW GUY IN THE BACK,

00:07:22.124 --> 00:07:25.127
HE'S GOT A CLOAK ON.
CAN'T SEE WHAT HE'S CARRYING.

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:26.295
Ginrou: HE'S WEARIN' A CLOAK?!

00:07:26.337 --> 00:07:27.296
Dyne: YEAH.

00:07:27.338 --> 00:07:28.839
Ginrou: MAYBE IT'S HIM,

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.925
THAT DEATH GUN GUY
EVERYONE'S TALKIN' ABOUT!

00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:32.426
Dyne: HUH. NO WAY!

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.471
WHAT, YOU BELIEVE IN
FAIRY TALES NOW?

00:07:35.512 --> 00:07:37.139
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S
STRENGTH‐BUILD.

00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:39.266
PROBABLY JUST A COURIER, THOUGH.

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:41.602
IF ANYTHING, I BET HE'S
CARRYING THE SQUAD'S AMMO,

00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:43.312
ENERGY PACKS AND DROPS.

00:07:43.354 --> 00:07:45.147
EH, WE CAN IGNORE HIM.

00:07:50.527 --> 00:07:53.322
Sinon: I'M GETTING A BAD VIBE
FROM THE GUY IN BACK.

00:07:53.364 --> 00:07:56.242
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE HIM OUT
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.

00:07:56.283 --> 00:07:58.827
Dyne: NO WAY. HE'S NOT
CARRYING ANY WEAPONS.

00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:00.871
Sinon: MAYBE HE IS.
MAYBE HE ISN'T.

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:02.831
HE'S AN UNKNOWN,
SO HE'S A RISK.

00:08:02.873 --> 00:08:04.708
Dyne: I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYIN',

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.127
BUT THERE'S ALSO A MINIMI
OUT THERE, AND THAT'S A PROBLEM.

00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:09.505
IF HE STARTS LIGHTING US UP
AND THOSE BLASTERS MOVE IN,

00:08:09.546 --> 00:08:11.465
IT'S GONNA GET UGLY.

00:08:11.507 --> 00:08:14.885
Sinon: UNDERSTOOD. I'LL DROP
THE GUY WITH THE MINIMI FIRST,

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:18.347
BUT MY SECOND BULLET'S
GOT MR. CLOAK'S NAME ON IT.

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:21.267
Player #4: HATE TO INTERRUPT YOU
GUYS, BUT THEY'RE CLOSING ON US.

00:08:21.308 --> 00:08:22.935
THEY'RE AT TWENTY‐FIVE
HUNDRED METERS.

00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:24.436
Dyne: ALL RIGHT.

00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:25.938
'WE'RE GONNA STICK WITH
THE ORIGINAL PLAN

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.856
AND WAIT FOR 'EM
IN THE SHADOW OF THAT BUILDING.

00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:30.818
SINON, CALL OUT
IF THE SITUATION CHANGES.

00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:32.778
WAIT FOR MY ORDER TO FIRE.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.280
Sinon: ROGER.

00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:35.739
Dyne: ALL RIGHT, MOVE OUT.

00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:17.364
Dyne: I'M IN POSITION.

00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:19.658
Sinon: ROGER. TARGETS
HAVEN'T CHANGED THEIR COURSE,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.160
OR THEIR SPEED.

00:09:21.201 --> 00:09:22.995
THEY'RE FOUR HUNDRED
METERS FROM YOU,

00:09:23.037 --> 00:09:24.288
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FROM ME.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.415
Dyne: PRETTY FAR.
CAN YOU MAKE THE SHOT?

00:09:26.457 --> 00:09:27.791
Sinon: NO SWEAT.

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.835
Dyne: OKAY, THEN.
FIRE WHEN READY.

00:09:29.877 --> 00:09:31.337
I'M COUNTING ON YOU, SINON.

00:09:31.378 --> 00:09:32.463
Sinon: ROGER.

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.012
THIS PRESSURE...

00:09:40.054 --> 00:09:42.306
THIS ANXIETY...

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.391
THIS FEAR.

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:46.352
FIFTEEN HUNDRED METERS,

00:09:46.393 --> 00:09:47.728
THAT'S NOTHING,

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.065
LIKE TOSSING A WAD OF PAPER
INTO A TRASH CAN.

00:09:51.106 --> 00:09:52.775
NO WAY.

00:09:52.816 --> 00:09:56.195
THIS IS NOTHING LIKE
HOW IT FELT THAT DAY.

00:09:56.236 --> 00:09:57.780
(HEART BEATING)

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:09.249
NEXT.

00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:18.425
(INHALES)

00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:21.553
(EXHALES)

00:10:21.595 --> 00:10:23.389
CAN'T CHANGE POSITION.

00:10:24.932 --> 00:10:26.642
I CLEARED THE FIRST TARGET,

00:10:26.684 --> 00:10:29.061
BUT I COULDN'T POP
THE SECOND ONE.

00:10:29.103 --> 00:10:32.106
Dyne: ROGER THAT.
SIT TIGHT UP THERE, YOU HEAR?

00:10:32.147 --> 00:10:33.482
GO, GO, GO!

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:58.382
(GASPS)

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.801
HE'S GOT A...MINIGUN!

00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:04.346
THEY'RE NOT LATE 'CAUSE
THEIR HUNT WAS RUNNING LONG.

00:11:04.388 --> 00:11:06.265
THEY'RE MOVING SLOW
IN THE FIELD,

00:11:06.306 --> 00:11:07.474
'CAUSE THE WEIGHT
OF THAT MINIGUN'S

00:11:07.516 --> 00:11:08.851
GOT A MOVEMENT PENALTY!

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.325
Ginrou: (LAUGHING)

00:11:29.872 --> 00:11:31.165
HMM.

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:40.424
Ginrou: SCORE!

00:11:42.926 --> 00:11:44.261
HA! I KNEW IT.

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:46.597
THIS OP'S GONNA BE A CAKEWALK.

00:12:06.366 --> 00:12:07.868
Sinon: (GASPS)

00:12:15.459 --> 00:12:17.211
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:12:17.252 --> 00:12:19.671
IF HE CAN SMILE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIREFIGHT,

00:12:19.713 --> 00:12:21.465
HE MUST BE PRETTY BRAVE...

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.302
OR CRAZY.

00:12:27.429 --> 00:12:29.848
Sinon: EITHER WAY, HE'S MINE!

00:12:40.952 --> 00:12:42.287
Dyne: DUCK!

00:12:43.747 --> 00:12:46.333
CRAP!
DON'T LET HIM GET CLOSER! FIRE!

00:12:46.374 --> 00:12:47.751
Player #3:
Y‐YEAH, ROGER THAT!

00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:54.633
(BULLETS WHIZZING)

00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:02.807
Dyne: GOTTA FIND SOME COVER.
BUT WHERE?

00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:05.977
WHERE, DAMN IT. WHERE?!

00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:09.356
S‐SINON?

00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:31.294
Player #3: SINON!
ARE YOU HIT?

00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:36.383
Dyne: BASTARDS.

00:13:36.424 --> 00:13:38.301
(GROWLS)

00:13:38.343 --> 00:13:40.678
THEY TEAMED UP WITH
A FREAKIN' BODYGUARD!

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.639
Sinon: BODYGUARD?

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.183
Dyne: IT'S THAT GUY
WITH THE MINIGUN.

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:47.811
HE'S A MACHO PRICK,
CALLS HIMSELF BEHEMOTH.

00:13:47.852 --> 00:13:49.104
Sinon: WELL, WE CAN'T
KEEP SITTING HERE,

00:13:49.145 --> 00:13:50.897
'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA
WIPE US OUT!

00:13:50.939 --> 00:13:54.442
THAT MINIGUN'S ONLY GOT
SO MUCH AMMO TO FIRE.

00:13:54.484 --> 00:13:56.903
IF WE ATTACK HIM AT ONCE,
HE'LL PANIC

00:13:56.945 --> 00:13:58.446
AND BURN THROUGH
THE REST OF IT.

00:13:58.488 --> 00:14:00.990
JIN AND MISO,
YOU TAKE THE LEFT FLANK.

00:14:01.032 --> 00:14:02.909
DYNE AND I'LL
COME IN FROM THE RIGHT.

00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:05.203
ARASHI, YOU STAY HERE
AND COVER US.

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:06.955
Dyne: THAT'S CRAZY.

00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:08.665
Dyne: WHAT ABOUT
THE THREE GUYS OUT THERE

00:14:08.706 --> 00:14:10.875
CARRYING THE BLASTERS?
EVEN IF WE RUSH 'EM,

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.794
OUR DEFENSE SHIELDS
AREN'T ENOUGH!

00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:14.379
Sinon: RIGHT, BUT THEIR
BLASTERS CAN'T FIRE

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:15.797
AS FAST AS A LIVE‐AMMO GUN.

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:17.215
WE CAN JUST DODGE 'EM!

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:19.175
Dyne: SCREW THAT! IF WE GO
CHARGING OUT THERE,

00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:21.678
THAT MINIGUN'LL
TURN US INTO CONFETTI!

00:14:21.719 --> 00:14:23.972
(DEEP BREATH)

00:14:24.013 --> 00:14:26.683
SORRY, BUT WE'RE PACKIN' IT IN.

00:14:26.724 --> 00:14:28.893
IT'S BETTER IF WE
LOGGED OUT RIGHT NOW.

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:31.146
AT LEAST WE'LL BE
ABLE TO GET AWAY.

00:14:31.187 --> 00:14:34.732
Sinon: YOU DON'T GET AWAY
FROM THINGS BY LOGGING OUT.

00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:36.901
Dyne: ARE YOU NUTS?! THIS IS
A GAME, FOR CHRIST SAKES!

00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:38.361
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:14:38.403 --> 00:14:39.988
EVEN IF WE CHARGED 'EM,
WE'D JUST DIE!

00:14:40.029 --> 00:14:43.408
‐ Sinon: THEN DIE!
‐ Dyne: (GASPS)

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.952
Sinon: IT IS A GAME, SO YOU
CAN AT LEAST HAVE THE BALLS

00:14:45.994 --> 00:14:47.454
TO FACE DEATH HERE
INSTEAD OF WHININ'!

00:14:54.335 --> 00:14:55.920
Sinon: WE CAN DO THIS.

00:14:55.962 --> 00:14:58.173
IF YOU CAN DISTRACT
THE MINIGUN FOR THREE SECONDS,

00:14:58.214 --> 00:14:59.466
I CAN TAKE HIM OUT.

00:14:59.507 --> 00:15:00.675
Player #3: O‐OKAY.

00:15:00.717 --> 00:15:02.177
Sinon: GOOD.
THEN WE'LL SPLIT UP

00:15:02.218 --> 00:15:04.179
AND ATTACK HIM
FROM BOTH SIDES. GOT IT?

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.388
‐ Player #2: GOT IT!
‐ Player #3: GOT IT!

00:15:20.778 --> 00:15:21.821
Sinon: GO!

00:15:34.626 --> 00:15:36.211
DYNE! COVER ME!

00:16:03.571 --> 00:16:05.990
Dyne: HOW YOU LIKE THAT, PUNK?!

00:16:29.597 --> 00:16:33.017
(SCREAMING)

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:34.477
SCREW YOU!

00:16:36.896 --> 00:16:39.649
(SCREAMING)

00:16:43.194 --> 00:16:45.029

‐ Opponent #2: (LAUGHING)

00:16:48.157 --> 00:16:49.409
(SCREAMING)

00:16:57.166 --> 00:17:00.211
Sinon: NICE GOING! NOW...

00:17:00.253 --> 00:17:03.965
I'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW TO
GET INTO BEHEMOTH'S BLIND SPOT.

00:17:07.176 --> 00:17:08.511
I'D BETTER MOVE FAST.

00:17:08.553 --> 00:17:10.930
OR HE'S GONNA GET
A BEAD ON MY LOCATION.

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:18.980
BULLETS ARE FLYIN', AND HE'S GOT
THE GUTS TO SMILE LIKE THAT.

00:17:22.483 --> 00:17:25.320
MAYBE I WILL,
TOO, WHEN I KILL HIM.

00:17:40.877 --> 00:17:42.045
(GASPS)

00:17:53.681 --> 00:17:58.102
Behemoth: (LAUGHING)

00:18:22.293 --> 00:18:23.378
Sinon: YOU'RE DEAD.

00:19:26.607 --> 00:19:28.943
(SHUDDERS)

00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:44.792
DAMN IT.

00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:48.629
I GOTTA GET STRONGER.

00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:50.126

Leafa: YOU WANNA
KEEP GOING SOME MORE?

00:20:51.752 --> 00:20:54.004
YOU ALWAYS HOOK US UP AT
YOUR SHOP, SO IF YOU NEED MORE,

00:20:54.046 --> 00:20:55.589
WE DON'T MIND HELPING.

Lisbeth: THANKS, GUYS.
ALTHOUGH...

00:20:57.842 --> 00:21:01.846
HMM. WE SORTA PICKED
THIS PLACE CLEAN, DIDN'T WE?

00:21:01.887 --> 00:21:04.056

00:21:04.098 --> 00:21:05.099

00:21:09.916 --> 00:21:12.502
THEY'RE SO INTO EACH OTHER.

DAMN IT.

Leafa: NOW, NOW...!

00:21:15.755 --> 00:21:18.341
Lisbeth: UCH. DOESN'T MATTER
IF THEY'RE AT SCHOOL OR HERE,

00:21:18.382 --> 00:21:20.718
THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR HANDS
OFF EACH OTHER!

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.137
