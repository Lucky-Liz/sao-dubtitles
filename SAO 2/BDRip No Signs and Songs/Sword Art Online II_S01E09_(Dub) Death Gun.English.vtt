WEBVTT

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.803
(GUNFIRE)

00:00:07.347 --> 00:00:10.308
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:14.646
Leafa: HMM, WHERE'S KAZUTO?

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:16.731
HE SHOULD HAVE SHOWN UP BY NOW.

00:00:16.773 --> 00:00:18.024
Silica: MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.068
ALL THE BATTLES UP
ON THE FEED YET.

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.320
I MEAN, KNOWING KIRITO,
WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:24.113
RUNNING AROUND,
GUNS BLAZING FROM THE START.

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:25.698
Klein: I DON'T KNOW.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.034
HE'S ONE OF THE CRAFTIEST
PLAYERS I'VE EVER MET.

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:29.577
HE'S PROBABLY
LAYING LOW SOMEWHERE,

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.413
WAITING FOR THE COMPETITION
TO KILL EACH OTHER OFF.

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:34.874
Asuna: OH, PLEASE.

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.918
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
HE DOESN'T PLAY LIKE THAT.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.919
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, YUI?

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:38.920
Yui: ABSOLUTELY.

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:40.213
BESIDES, DADDY'S SO FAST,

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:42.507
I DOUBT HE'LL EVEN
SHOW UP ON CAMERA.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:43.841
HE'LL SNEAK UP AND STRIKE

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:45.343
BEFORE HIS ENEMY
KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:47.720
Lisbeth: (LAUGHS)
HE CAN'T DO IT ANY OTHER WAY.

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:50.598
I MEAN, IT'S A GAME WITH GUNS,
AND HE'S USING A SWORD.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.599
WHAT A DOOFUS.

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:52.809
All: (LAUGH)

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.270
Klein: YEAH,
HE IS KIND OF A DORK.

00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:56.729
‐ (GUNFIRE)
‐ Lisbeth: (WHISTLES)

00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:59.065
THAT ONE GUY'S UNBELIEVABLE.

00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:00.441
Asuna: HUH?

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:03.027
YOU MEAN THE ONE IN WHITE?

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.782
Dyne: (GROANS)

00:01:08.783 --> 00:01:10.118
(GUNSHOT)

00:01:15.164 --> 00:01:16.583
NO!

00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:28.928
Girls: (GASP)

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.013
Silica: HE'S SUPER FAST.

00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:32.181
Lisbeth: YEAH.

00:01:32.223 --> 00:01:33.474
THAT GUY'S SICK.

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:35.851
I BET HE'S GONNA WIN THIS THING.

00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:38.229
Girls: (GASP)

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.773
Klein: LOOKS LIKE YOUR BOY
IS FULL OF SUCK, LIZ.

00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:43.234
Lisbeth: SHUT UP.
HE'S NOT OUT OF IT YET.

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.697
Silica: WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.660
Yui: IT'S SOME KIND
OF PARALYSIS ATTACK,

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:54.411
MOST LIKELY TEMPORARY.

00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:57.122
Leafa: IT'S LIKE HE WAS HIT

00:01:57.164 --> 00:01:58.874
WITH THAT WIND SPELL,
THUNDER WEB.

00:02:07.842 --> 00:02:09.051
Girls: (GASP)

00:04:10.507 --> 00:04:11.675
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:15.971
SINON, SHOOT.

00:04:16.013 --> 00:04:17.306
Sinon: HUH? WHICH ONE?

00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:18.932
Kirito: IT'S THE GUY
IN THE CLOAK.

00:04:18.974 --> 00:04:20.642
THERE'S NO TIME! SHOOT HIM!

00:04:20.684 --> 00:04:21.643
HURRY!

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:23.854
DON'T LET HIM FIRE THAT GUN!

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:30.402
Sinon: (GASPS)

00:04:35.324 --> 00:04:37.117
OH, CRAP.

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.869
HE KNEW I WAS HERE.

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.287
Kirito: HOW COULD HE?

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:42.289
Sinon: MAYBE HE
SPOTTED ME EARLIER,

00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:44.666
GOT MY POSITION
FROM THE LAST SCAN.

00:05:16.907 --> 00:05:17.866
Both: (GASP)

00:05:17.908 --> 00:05:19.701
(CRACKLING)

00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.214
Sinon: JESUS. WHAT WAS THAT?

00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:44.977
Girls: (GASP)

00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:48.522
Death Gun:
DEATH GUN IS MY NAME

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:51.942
AND THE NAME OF MY GUN.

00:05:53.944 --> 00:05:59.199
ONE DAY,
I'LL PAY YOU ALL A VISIT, TOO,

00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.745
AND BRING REAL DEATH
WITH THIS GUN.

00:06:03.787 --> 00:06:06.248
YOU'VE SEEN MY POWER.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.875
IT IS REAL.

00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:11.962
THIS ISN'T OVER, NOT YET.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:15.048
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

00:06:16.466 --> 00:06:19.094
IT'S SHOWTIME.

00:06:21.972 --> 00:06:24.850
Asuna: I'VE MET
THAT PERSON BEFORE.

00:06:24.892 --> 00:06:26.143
BUT WHERE?

00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:29.563
THERE'S ONLY
ONE PLACE I COULD'VE,

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:31.106
AINCRAD.

00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:33.775
Girls: (GASP)

00:06:33.817 --> 00:06:36.320
Lisbeth: WAY TO SCARE
THE HELL OUTTA EVERYONE.

00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:38.614
Klein: YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:40.574
NO WAY. CAN'T BE.

00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:42.242
Asuna: YOU KNOW HIM, TOO?

00:06:42.284 --> 00:06:43.910
DO YOU REMEMBER HIS NAME?

00:06:43.952 --> 00:06:49.249
Klein: NO. I FORGET THE HANDLE
HE USED, BUT IT'S HIM.

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:50.876
THERE'S NO DOUBT.

00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:52.502
HE WAS IN LAUGHING COFFIN.

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:57.299
Asuna: LAUGHING COFFIN.

00:06:57.341 --> 00:06:58.800
WAS HE THEIR LEADER?

00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:00.844
YOU KNOW, THE KNIFE WIELDER?

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:03.180
Klein: NO.
PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT POH.

00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:06.808
SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THIS GUY
TALKS AND ACTS IS DIFFERENT.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.729
EXCEPT FOR
THAT "SHOWTIME" LINE, THOUGH.

00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:13.523
POH WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO SAID THAT.

00:07:13.565 --> 00:07:16.234
BUT THIS GUY,
HE WAS CLOSE TO POH.

00:07:16.276 --> 00:07:17.861
I'M TALKING
RIGHT‐HAND‐MAN CLOSE.

00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:20.530
Asuna: KIRITO.

00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:27.287
Kirito: IT'S HIM, ALL RIGHT.

00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:29.206
OH, YEAH. THAT'S DEATH GUN.

00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:30.540
Sinon: DEATH GUN?

00:07:30.582 --> 00:07:31.667
YOU'RE JOKING.

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.627
YOU MEAN
THOSE RUMORS ABOUT PLAYERS

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.296
GETTING SHOT AND DISAPPEARING,
THOSE ARE ALL TRUE?

00:07:36.338 --> 00:07:37.381
Kirito: YEAH, THEY ARE.

00:07:37.422 --> 00:07:39.633
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DOES IT YET,

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:42.302
BUT HE'S BEEN KILLING PLAYERS
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:07:42.344 --> 00:07:43.303
Sinon: THAT'S INSANE!

00:07:43.345 --> 00:07:44.471
Kirito: IT'S NOT.

00:07:44.513 --> 00:07:47.307
TWO PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED DEAD.

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.614
WHERE'D HE GO?

00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.574
(WATCH ALARM BEEPING)

00:08:08.328 --> 00:08:10.664
Sinon: KIRITO,
WATCH THE BRIDGE FOR A SEC.

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:14.126
I'M GONNA CHECK THE SCAN AND
SEE WHAT NAME HE'S GOING BY.

00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:15.460
Kirito: YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

00:08:28.306 --> 00:08:29.307
Sinon: HUH?

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:31.393
WHERE IS HE?

00:08:31.435 --> 00:08:33.645
COULD HE HAVE MOVED THAT FAST?

00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:36.022
NO.

00:08:36.064 --> 00:08:38.316
THIS IS OUR CHANCE.

00:08:38.358 --> 00:08:39.317
Kirito: FOR WHAT?

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:40.694
Sinon: YOUR PAL IN THE CLOAK

00:08:40.736 --> 00:08:42.070
ISN'T SHOWING UP
ON THE TERMINAL.

00:08:42.112 --> 00:08:44.281
MY GUESS IS
HE JUMPED IN THE RIVER.

00:08:44.322 --> 00:08:45.615
IF I'M RIGHT,

00:08:45.657 --> 00:08:48.285
THEN HE HAD TO DISABLE
HIS GEAR LIKE YOU DID.

00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:49.828
Kirito: WHAT ABOUT HIS HANDGUN?

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.247
HE CAN STILL MOVE UNDERWATER
WITH THAT EQUIPPED, RIGHT?

00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:54.416
Sinon: EVEN IF HE COULD,
IT'S JUST ONE LITTLE HANDGUN.

00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:56.251
I COULD TAKE HIM OUT EASY
WITH MY HECATE.

00:08:56.293 --> 00:08:58.128
Kirito: YOU CAN'T!

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.504
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:02.507
HE USED THAT LITTLE GUN
TO KILL PALE RIDER.

00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:04.217
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE SHOT.

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:06.803
GET IT? ONE SHOT,
AND YOU'RE DEAD FOR REAL!

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:12.267
Sinon: YEAH, WELL,
I'M NOT BUYING IT.

00:09:12.309 --> 00:09:14.227
HOW'S IT EVEN POSSIBLE?

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:17.230
I MEAN, A PLAYER
KILLING PEOPLE I.R.L.?

00:09:17.272 --> 00:09:21.485
Kirito: I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:24.279
THIS DEATH GUN GUY
KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:26.156
IN THAT V.R.M.M.O. I WAS IN.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:28.450
WHEN HE USED HIS SWORD
ON SOMEONE,

00:09:28.492 --> 00:09:30.827
HE KNEW HE WAS
REALLY KILLING 'EM.

00:09:32.788 --> 00:09:34.998
AND SO DID I.

00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:42.672
Sinon: THERE'S A KILLER,
A MURDERER, IN G.G.O.?

00:09:46.843 --> 00:09:49.471
Woman: (SCREAMS)

00:09:49.513 --> 00:09:53.975
Robber: (LAUGHS)

00:09:54.017 --> 00:09:55.644
Kirito: SINON.

00:09:55.685 --> 00:09:56.645
SINON!

00:09:56.686 --> 00:09:57.687
Sinon: (GASPS)

00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:01.900
I'M ALL RIGHT,

00:10:01.942 --> 00:10:03.902
JUST A LITTLE FREAKED OUT.

00:10:03.944 --> 00:10:07.489
ANYWAY, I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED
WHAT YOU TOLD ME'S POSSIBLE,

00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:11.201
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
LYING TO ME ABOUT IT, EITHER.

00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:12.536
Kirito: THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

00:10:12.577 --> 00:10:14.204
I CAN'T ASK FOR MORE.

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:18.291
Sinon: YEAH, WELL, WE BETTER
GET OUT OF THE AREA ASAP.

00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:20.502
THE OTHERS KNOW
WE'RE HERE BY NOW.

00:10:20.544 --> 00:10:22.712
THEY THINK WE'RE BUSY
FIGHTING EACH OTHER,

00:10:22.754 --> 00:10:24.422
SO THEY'LL BE CLOSING IN SOON.

00:10:24.464 --> 00:10:26.007
Kirito: YOU GOT A POINT.

00:10:26.049 --> 00:10:27.801
WE'LL SPLIT UP HERE THEN.

00:10:27.843 --> 00:10:30.137
Sinon: WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:10:30.178 --> 00:10:32.556
Kirito: I'M GOING
AFTER DEATH GUN ALONE.

00:10:32.597 --> 00:10:34.891
WHATEVER YOU DO,
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:35.934
Sinon: BUT‐‐

00:10:35.976 --> 00:10:36.977
Kirito: I'LL KEEP MY PROMISE.

00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:38.228
NEXT TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER,

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.855
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE FIGHT I OWE YOU.

00:10:39.896 --> 00:10:41.314
OH, AND ONE MORE THING,

00:10:41.356 --> 00:10:43.233
THANKS FOR HEARING ME OUT
JUST NOW

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:44.317
INSTEAD OF SHOOTING ME

00:10:44.359 --> 00:10:45.610
Sinon: HUH?

00:10:47.028 --> 00:10:48.697
HEY!

00:10:50.407 --> 00:10:52.492
(GROANS)

00:10:53.952 --> 00:10:55.829
WAIT FOR ME!

00:10:57.747 --> 00:10:59.040
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

00:10:59.082 --> 00:11:00.417
Kirito: WHAT?

00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:02.377
Sinon: THAT DEATH GUN GUY
SEEMS PRETTY TOUGH,

00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:05.046
AND IF HE KILLS YOU,
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIGHT ME.

00:11:05.088 --> 00:11:06.590
Kirito: I DON'T THINK YOU GET‐‐

00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:08.592
Sinon: LOOK, I'M NOT
A FAN OF TEAMING UP, EITHER,

00:11:08.633 --> 00:11:10.218
BUT I THINK
WE STAND A BETTER CHANCE

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.845
OF KNOCKING THAT GUY
OUT OF THE GAME

00:11:11.887 --> 00:11:13.096
IF WE WORK TOGETHER.

00:11:13.138 --> 00:11:15.307
Kirito:
NO, I'M NOT DOWN WITH THAT.

00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:17.058
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.853
Sinon: WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE'LL POP UP NEXT,

00:11:19.895 --> 00:11:23.023
SO IT'LL BE DANGEROUS
WHETHER WE'RE TOGETHER OR NOT.

00:11:25.066 --> 00:11:27.485
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:44.586
Kakouton: HUH?

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:47.797
Kirito: WE BETTER
TAKE CARE OF THIS JOKER.

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:50.508
I'LL BLOCK HIS BULLETS.
YOU WAIT FOR AN OPENING.

00:11:54.554 --> 00:11:55.680
Sinon: ROGER THAT.

00:12:08.485 --> 00:12:09.486
Kirito: HE'S ALL YOURS!

00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:17.786
Kakouton: NO WAY.

00:12:37.264 --> 00:12:40.267
Kirito: DEATH GUN'S PROBABLY
HEADING NORTH UP THE RIVER.

00:12:40.308 --> 00:12:42.394
I WANNA BE THERE
WHEN HE SURFACES,

00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:44.562
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE'LL STOP.

00:12:44.604 --> 00:12:46.106
GOT ANY IDEAS, SINON?

00:12:46.147 --> 00:12:48.149
Sinon: UH...

00:12:49.818 --> 00:12:52.404
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOT
ANY OTHER SPECIAL SKILLS,

00:12:52.445 --> 00:12:54.823
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,
HE'S A SNIPER.

00:12:54.864 --> 00:12:58.451
HE'S GONNA AVOID OPEN SPACES
AND LOOK FOR A PLACE WITH COVER.

00:12:58.493 --> 00:13:02.872
IF I WERE HIM, I'D SET MYSELF UP
IN THE RUINS OF THAT CITY.

00:13:02.914 --> 00:13:05.834
Kirito: GOOD. THEN THAT'S
WHERE YOU AND ME ARE GONNA GO.

00:13:09.087 --> 00:13:10.463
Sinon: ON YOUR SIX.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.733
Klein: IN S.A.O.,
WE HAD A CODE.

00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:30.485
NEVER LET ANOTHER PLAYER'S H. P.
HIT ZERO,

00:13:30.527 --> 00:13:31.862
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:13:31.903 --> 00:13:34.197
WE KNEW
IF IT DROPPED TO NOTHING,

00:13:34.239 --> 00:13:36.867
THAT PLAYER WOULD DIE.

00:13:37.909 --> 00:13:39.578
LAUGHING COFFIN DIDN'T CARE.

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:41.121
THEY KILLED DOZENS‐‐

00:13:41.163 --> 00:13:42.789
NO, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

00:13:42.831 --> 00:13:46.460
THE ASSAULT TEAM
HAD TO STEP IN.

00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:48.211
THEY PUT A PARTY TOGETHER

00:13:48.253 --> 00:13:51.131
TO HUNT 'EM DOWN
AND CAPTURE THEM.

00:13:51.173 --> 00:13:54.134
Leafa: AND KAZUTO
WAS THERE WITH YOU?

00:13:54.176 --> 00:13:57.888
Kirito: YEAH. HE WAS UP FRONT,
GOING TOE TO TOE.

00:13:57.929 --> 00:14:00.474
EVERYTHING WENT TO HELL
PRETTY FAST.

00:14:00.515 --> 00:14:02.100
Leafa: OH, MAN.

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:04.644
THAT'S WHY KAZUTO'S
BEEN ACTING SO WEIRD LATELY.

00:14:04.686 --> 00:14:06.229
NOW I'M WORRIED.

00:14:06.271 --> 00:14:09.066
MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO SETTLE
SOME GRUDGE OR SOMETHING

00:14:09.107 --> 00:14:10.442
Lisbeth: GRUDGE?

00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:12.736
ISN'T THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE A PART‐TIME JOB?

00:14:14.071 --> 00:14:15.781
Asuna: SORRY.
I'M LOGGING OUT FOR A BIT.

00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:17.365
Silica: WHY?

00:14:17.407 --> 00:14:19.618
Asuna: I HAVE TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH KIRITO'S CLIENT.

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:21.411
Silica: WAIT. HE'S GOT A CLIENT?

00:14:21.453 --> 00:14:24.623
Asuna: MM‐HMM. HE'S THE ONE WHO
GOT KIRITO TO DIVE INTO G.G.O.

00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:26.833
I BET HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:30.587
OH, AND, YUI, I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR HELP WHILE I'M GONE.

00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:32.798
FIND OUT
ANYTHING YOU CAN ABOUT G.G.O.

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:34.758
Yui: YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, MOMMY!

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.385
Asuna: I'LL BE BACK
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

00:14:37.427 --> 00:14:38.428
WISH ME LUCK.

00:14:56.822 --> 00:14:59.032
Sinon: WHERE THE HECK DID HE GO?

00:14:59.074 --> 00:15:01.743
YOU THINK WE MIGHT'VE PASSED HIM
ON THE WAY OVER HERE?

00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:03.245
Kirito: NO, WE DIDN'T PASS HIM.

00:15:03.286 --> 00:15:05.205
I WAS KEEPING AN EYE
ON THE RIVER

00:15:05.247 --> 00:15:06.665
THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE RUNNING.

00:15:06.706 --> 00:15:08.333
Sinon: OH.

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:10.001
WELL, THE RIVER DEAD‐ENDS HERE.

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.337
I GUESS
HE MUST BE LURKING AROUND

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:14.089
SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY NOW.

00:15:14.131 --> 00:15:15.715
Kirito: OKAY.

00:15:15.757 --> 00:15:19.052
LISTEN, WHEN HIS LOCATION
POPS UP IN THE NEXT SCAN,

00:15:19.094 --> 00:15:21.930
WE'LL RUSH HIM
BEFORE HE CAN KILL ANYONE ELSE.

00:15:21.972 --> 00:15:23.431
Sinon: I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

00:15:23.473 --> 00:15:25.767
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM.

00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:28.270
HOW WILL WE KNOW
WHO DEATH GUN IS?

00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:30.939
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT
HIS AVATAR'S HANDLE, REMEMBER?

00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:32.858
Kirito: UH, OH, YEAH. RIGHT.

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:35.360
THEN LET'S START
WITH WHAT WE KNOW.

00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:38.864
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
THE NAMES OF THREE NEW PLAYERS.

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:41.533
IT'S NOT PALE RIDER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:15:41.575 --> 00:15:45.453
THAT LEAVES US WITH TWO NAMES
IN PLAY THAT COULD BE DEATH GUN,

00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:47.956
JUSHI X AND STERBEN.

00:15:47.998 --> 00:15:50.167
Sinon: IF THEY'RE
BOTH IN THE CITY,

00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:53.086
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO PICK THE WRONG ONE.

00:15:53.128 --> 00:15:56.381
WAIT A SEC.
I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:59.634
IN JAPANESE, THE "SHI"
IN "JUSHI" MEANS DEATH.

00:15:59.676 --> 00:16:00.635
GET IT?

00:16:00.677 --> 00:16:02.637
AND THE "X" COULD MEAN CROSS,

00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:04.806
LIKE MAKING
THE SIGN OF THE CROSS!

00:16:04.848 --> 00:16:07.017
YOU THINK?
OR MAYBE IT'S TOO OBVIOUS

00:16:07.058 --> 00:16:09.060
Kirito: HMM. MAYBE NOT.

00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:12.230
AREN'T AVATAR NAMES
USUALLY SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS?

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:14.566
MINE'S A VARIATION
ON MY REAL NAME.

00:16:14.608 --> 00:16:15.567
AND YOURS?

00:16:15.609 --> 00:16:17.903
Sinon: YEAH, SAME HERE.

00:16:21.364 --> 00:16:23.533
Kirito:
WELL, IF THEY'RE BOTH HERE,

00:16:23.575 --> 00:16:25.535
WE'LL GO AFTER JUSHI X FIRST.

00:16:25.577 --> 00:16:29.080
OH, AND IF I GET PARALYZED
LIKE PALE RIDER, DON'T PANIC.

00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:30.582
GET INTO POSITION, AND WAIT.

00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:32.167
Sinon: HUH?

00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:34.044
Kirito: DEATH GUN'S PROBABLY
HIDING SOMEWHERE CLOSE.

00:16:34.085 --> 00:16:36.296
WHEN HE COMES OUT
TO FINISH ME OFF,

00:16:36.338 --> 00:16:37.547
THAT'S WHEN YOU SHOOT HIM.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.009
Sinon: AREN'T YOU WORRIED
I'LL SHOOT YOU, TOO?

00:16:41.051 --> 00:16:42.719
Kirito: ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:16:42.761 --> 00:16:45.096
YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
I'D EXPECT TO PLAY IT LIKE THAT.

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:48.725
LET'S GO, PARTNER.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

00:16:58.026 --> 00:17:01.279
Sinon: OKAY, BUT ONCE
WE GET HIM, ALL BETS ARE OFF!

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.629
KIRITO, CHECK THE NORTH SIDE
OF THE MAP.

00:17:23.595 --> 00:17:25.556
IT'S HIM.

00:17:25.597 --> 00:17:27.516
HE'S THE ONLY ONE IN THE CITY.

00:17:27.558 --> 00:17:29.142
I GUESS HE'S OUR MAN, HUH.

00:17:29.184 --> 00:17:30.978
Kirito: YEAH.
I DON'T SEE STERBEN AROUND.

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:34.606
THAT SETTLES IT. JUSHI X AND
DEATH GUN ARE ONE AND THE SAME.

00:17:34.648 --> 00:17:36.024
THAT MEANS HE'S GOING AFTER...

00:17:36.066 --> 00:17:37.901
HIM.

00:17:37.943 --> 00:17:39.570
Sinon: WE BETTER MOVE FAST.

00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:40.904
RICOCO'S ALMOST IN RANGE.

00:17:40.946 --> 00:17:43.115
Kirito: YEAH.
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

00:17:43.156 --> 00:17:44.449
Sinon: YUP.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.264
FOUND HIM. UP THERE.

00:18:15.306 --> 00:18:16.869
Kirito: HE'S PROBABLY
WAITING FOR RICOCO

00:18:16.911 --> 00:18:18.260
TO WALK RIGHT UP
INTO HIS SIGHTS.

00:18:18.801 --> 00:18:21.846
I'LL ATTACK JUSHI X FROM BEHIND
WHILE I GOT THE CHANCE.

00:18:21.888 --> 00:18:23.681
THAT BUILDING
IN FRONT OF THE STADIUM

00:18:23.723 --> 00:18:26.017
MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE
FOR YOU TO GET INTO POSITION.

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:28.561
Sinon: NO. I'M COMING WITH YOU.

00:18:28.603 --> 00:18:29.938
Kirito: NOT THIS TIME.

00:18:29.979 --> 00:18:33.107
I CAN FIGHT WAY BETTER
KNOWING YOU GOT MY BACK.

00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:34.484
WE'RE A TEAM, REMEMBER?

00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.153
Sinon: MM‐HMM.

00:18:38.905 --> 00:18:41.616
Kirito: ALL I'M GONNA NEED
IS 30 SECONDS TO GET UP THERE,

00:18:41.658 --> 00:18:43.493
AND I'LL BE READY
TO TAKE HIM OUT.

00:18:43.534 --> 00:18:44.994
IS THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU?

00:18:45.036 --> 00:18:46.746
Sinon: MM‐HMM. PLENTY.

00:18:46.788 --> 00:18:49.123
Kirito: COOL. SEE YOU IN A BIT.

00:18:56.965 --> 00:18:58.841
Birds: (CAWING)

00:19:06.516 --> 00:19:11.354
Sinon: SOON AS DEATH GUN'S GONE,
WE'LL BE ENEMIES AGAIN.

00:19:11.396 --> 00:19:13.773
I'LL SHOOT HIM, BEAT HIM,

00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:16.192
AND THEN FORGET HIM.

00:19:17.402 --> 00:19:19.028
WHATEVER.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.864
IT'S NOT LIKE I'LL EVER
SEE HIM AGAIN AFTER THIS.

00:19:30.123 --> 00:19:31.749
WHAT?

00:19:37.422 --> 00:19:39.757
BUT...

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:42.885
DEATH GUN'S SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE STADIUM.

00:19:52.729 --> 00:19:53.730
(GASPS)

00:20:09.537 --> 00:20:13.416
Death Gun:
KIRITO, WHEREVER YOU ARE,

00:20:13.458 --> 00:20:18.254
IT'S TIME I FOUND OUT IF YOU'RE
THE REAL DEAL OR A FAKE.

00:20:19.881 --> 00:20:22.842
I REMEMBER
HOW YOU FOUGHT BACK THEN,

00:20:22.884 --> 00:20:25.970
ALL FURY AND RAGE.

00:20:26.012 --> 00:20:29.223
IF I KILL THIS FRIEND OF YOURS

00:20:29.265 --> 00:20:31.851
AND YOU GO BERSERK
LIKE I REMEMBER,

00:20:31.893 --> 00:20:34.103
I'LL KNOW IT'S REALLY YOU.

00:20:35.104 --> 00:20:37.565
Sinon: HE'S GONNA KILL ME?

00:20:39.108 --> 00:20:41.402
Death Gun: COME ON, KIRITO.

00:20:41.444 --> 00:20:43.071
SHOW ME.

00:20:43.112 --> 00:20:45.156
LET'S SEE YOUR FURY,

00:20:45.198 --> 00:20:47.492
YOUR RAGE,

00:20:47.533 --> 00:20:50.703
YOUR INSANE SWORD.

00:20:50.745 --> 00:20:54.165
SHOW ME FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

00:21:09.138 --> 00:21:13.267
Sinon: A TYPE 54 BLACK STAR.

00:21:22.276 --> 00:21:23.945
IT'S THE GUN.

00:21:25.238 --> 00:21:26.989
WHY?

00:21:27.031 --> 00:21:28.491
WHY HERE?

00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:30.993
WHY DOES HE HAVE THAT GUN?

00:21:52.348 --> 00:21:53.975
Robber: (LAUGHS)

00:21:54.016 --> 00:21:56.435
(HEART BEATING)

00:22:03.609 --> 00:22:05.987
(GUNSHOT ECHOES)
