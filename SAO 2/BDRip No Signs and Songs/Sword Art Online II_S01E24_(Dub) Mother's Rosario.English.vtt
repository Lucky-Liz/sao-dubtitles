00:13:45.877 --> 00:13:48.463
Asuna: YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING.

00:13:48.505 --> 00:13:51.091
YOU CARVED IT
DEEP INTO MY HEART,

00:13:51.132 --> 00:13:53.426
AND IT'LL ALWAYS BE THERE.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.185
Woman: HELLO, ASUNA.

00:14:02.227 --> 00:14:03.478
HOW ARE YOU?

00:14:05.689 --> 00:14:08.149
Asuna: WAIT.
IS THAT YOU, SIUNE?

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.652
Siune: YES, IN THE FLESH.

00:14:10.694 --> 00:14:13.280
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY
MEET YOU IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:14:13.321 --> 00:14:14.614
I'M SHI‐EUN AN.

00:14:14.656 --> 00:14:17.284
Asuna: OH!
I‐IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.

00:14:17.325 --> 00:14:19.077
I'M ASUNA YUUKI.

00:14:19.119 --> 00:14:21.788
LIKE MEETING
FOR THE FIRST TIME, HUH?

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.456
Both: (LAUGH)

00:14:24.874 --> 00:14:26.668
‐ Asuna: BUT‐‐
‐ Shi-eun: NO, IT'S OKAY.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.796
JUST THIS MONTH, I GOT
THE ALL‐CLEAR FROM MY DOCTOR

00:14:29.838 --> 00:14:31.673
AND WAS DISCHARGED
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

00:14:31.715 --> 00:14:33.341
Asuna: THEN,
YOU'RE DOING BETTER?

00:14:33.383 --> 00:14:34.884
Shi-eun: YES.

00:14:34.926 --> 00:14:36.886
THE TYPE OF DISEASE I HAVE

00:14:36.928 --> 00:14:38.805
IS CALLED
ACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA,

00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:42.475
AND IT WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
WHEN I DEVELOPED IT.

00:14:42.517 --> 00:14:45.854
THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM
THE MEDICINE WERE SO HORRIBLE,

00:14:45.895 --> 00:14:48.732
I WANTED TO DIE
RATHER THAN KEEP SUFFERING,

00:14:48.773 --> 00:14:52.277
BUT WHENEVER I SAW YUUKI,
I THOUGHT, "HERE'S THIS KID,

00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:55.947
AND SHE'S HANDLING HER SITUATION
BETTER THAN I'M HANDLING MINE."

00:14:55.989 --> 00:14:57.365
AROUND FEBRUARY,

00:14:57.407 --> 00:15:00.452
THEY STARTED CUTTING BACK
ON THE MEDS I WAS ON.

00:15:00.493 --> 00:15:02.078
I THOUGHT, "THIS IS IT,"

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.414
AND I BRACED MYSELF FOR THE END.

00:15:04.456 --> 00:15:06.875
AND THEN A WEEK AGO,

00:15:06.916 --> 00:15:08.501
THE DAY AFTER YUUKI DIED,

00:15:08.543 --> 00:15:10.503
MY DOCTOR CAME IN AND SAID,

00:15:10.545 --> 00:15:14.591
"CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE IN COMPLETE REMISSION."

00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:15.842
NEXT THING I KNEW,

00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:17.135
I WAS BEING DISCHARGED.

00:15:17.177 --> 00:15:20.013
I BARELY HAD A CHANCE
TO PROCESS THE NEWS.

00:15:20.055 --> 00:15:24.851
AND THE TRUTH IS,
IT STILL HASN'T SUNK IN YET.

00:15:24.893 --> 00:15:27.687
IT'S LIKE I SHOULD FEEL AWFUL.

00:15:27.729 --> 00:15:29.105
IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR

00:15:29.147 --> 00:15:31.441
THAT I'M STILL HERE
AND YUUKI'S WAITING.

00:15:31.483 --> 00:15:34.861
YUUKI AND RAN,
CLOVIS AND MERIDA,

00:15:34.903 --> 00:15:38.239
WE PROMISED
WE'D STICK TOGETHER FOREVER,

00:15:38.281 --> 00:15:40.283
AND I‐I'M HERE, AND‐‐

00:15:40.325 --> 00:15:42.661
Asuna: SHI‐EUN.

00:15:42.702 --> 00:15:45.622
YOU KNOW,
OUR LIVES ARE LIKE VESSELS,

00:15:45.664 --> 00:15:47.290
AND WE CARRY THE TEACHINGS

00:15:47.332 --> 00:15:49.584
OF THE ONES
WHO'VE PASSED IN THEM.

00:15:49.626 --> 00:15:52.253
FOR THE LONGEST TIME,
I WAS SO SCARED,

00:15:52.295 --> 00:15:54.923
SCARED OF TELLING SOMEONE
HOW I REALLY FELT

00:15:54.964 --> 00:15:57.092
AND SCARED OF FINDING OUT
HOW THEY FELT.

00:15:57.133 --> 00:15:58.927
BUT I LEARNED FROM YUUKI

00:15:58.968 --> 00:16:01.680
THAT THAT WAS NO WAY
FOR ME TO LIVE.

00:16:01.721 --> 00:16:03.682
IF I DIDN'T EVEN
TRY TO REACH OUT,

00:16:03.723 --> 00:16:06.893
NOTHING WOULD EVER CHANGE.

00:16:06.935 --> 00:16:08.965
SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO BE STRONG,

00:16:09.007 --> 00:16:10.967
AND I WANT TO SHARE THAT
WITH OTHERS.

00:16:11.009 --> 00:16:12.927
AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE,

00:16:12.969 --> 00:16:16.139
I'LL PASS ON WHAT I LEARNED
FROM HER TO EVERYONE I MEET,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.599
AND THEN SOMEDAY,
WHEN I SEE HER AGAIN,

00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:21.978
I WANT TO TELL HER ABOUT
ALL THE PEOPLE SHE'S HELPED.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.604
THAT'S HOW I'LL PAY HER BACK.

00:16:25.481 --> 00:16:27.317
Shi-eun: THANK YOU, ASUNA.

00:16:32.864 --> 00:16:38.202
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL SO GRATEFUL
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

00:16:38.244 --> 00:16:40.413
I'D BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT YUUKI.

00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:42.874
SHE WAS CARRYING A HEAVY BURDEN

00:16:42.915 --> 00:16:44.876
ON THOSE
LITTLE SHOULDERS OF HERS,

00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:48.880
BUT THEN YOU SHOWED UP,
AND SOMETHING IN HER CHANGED.

00:16:50.131 --> 00:16:51.424
WHEN YOU WERE TOGETHER,

00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:54.093
YUUKI SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS
REALLY HAVING FUN.

00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:57.805
SHE WAS LIKE A FORGETFUL BIRD
WHO REMEMBERED HOW TO FLY,

00:16:57.847 --> 00:17:03.644
AND SHE FLEW UP AND UP,
AND NOW SHE'S OUT OF OUR REACH.

00:17:06.814 --> 00:17:09.442
ANYWAY, JUN'S ALSO DOING GREAT.

00:17:09.484 --> 00:17:12.320
THE MEDICATION HE'S ON
SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

00:17:12.362 --> 00:17:13.821
IT'S LIKE‐‐I DON'T KNOW.

00:17:13.863 --> 00:17:16.366
TO ME, IT FEELS LIKE YUUKI'S
TELLING ALL OF US

00:17:16.407 --> 00:17:18.076
IT'S STILL TOO SOON TO JOIN HER.

00:17:18.117 --> 00:17:21.162
I GUESS THAT MEANS
IT'S GOING TO BE A WHILE YET

00:17:21.204 --> 00:17:22.997
BEFORE THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS
GET BACK TOGETHER.

00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:26.417
Asuna: JUST REMEMBER, NEXT TIME,
YOU'RE TAKING ME IN AS A MEMBER,

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:28.711
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY ARGUMENTS.

00:17:28.753 --> 00:17:29.712
Both: (LAUGH)

00:17:29.754 --> 00:17:30.922
Kazuto: HEY.

00:17:32.256 --> 00:17:35.343
I HOPE WE'RE
NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

00:17:35.385 --> 00:17:37.011
Asuna: NO. BUT WAIT.

00:17:37.053 --> 00:17:38.846
DO YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER?

00:17:38.888 --> 00:17:39.889
Kazuto: SORT OF.

00:17:39.931 --> 00:17:41.891
HE'S TRYING TO STEAL MY IDEAS

00:17:41.933 --> 00:17:43.893
ABOUT THAT COMMUNICATIONS POD
I MADE.

00:17:43.935 --> 00:17:45.520
Dr. Kurahashi: NO, HE'S LYING.

00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:47.063
I'M INTERESTED
IN ITS POSSIBILITIES

00:17:47.105 --> 00:17:48.398
IN FULL‐DIVE MEDICAL TECH,

00:17:48.439 --> 00:17:50.191
SO WE'VE BEEN
E‐MAILING BACK AND FORTH.

00:17:50.233 --> 00:17:52.276
Asuna: THAT'S GREAT
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

00:17:52.318 --> 00:17:53.945
WHAT ABOUT THE MEDICUBOID?

00:17:53.986 --> 00:17:57.407
ARE YOU GOING TO PHASE IT OUT,
OR WERE THE TRIALS SUCCESSFUL?

00:17:57.448 --> 00:18:00.076
Dr. Kurahashi: GLAD YOU ASKED.
THEY WERE EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL,

00:18:00.118 --> 00:18:03.579
AND NOW WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA
TO PROCEED TO THE NEXT PHASE.

00:18:03.621 --> 00:18:05.748
SOON, PATIENTS ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE‐‐

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.667
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

00:18:07.709 --> 00:18:10.336
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DIDN'T SAY THIS FIRST.

00:18:10.378 --> 00:18:13.297
MS. AN, CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR RECOVERY.

00:18:13.339 --> 00:18:16.384
I KNOW YUUKI WOULD BE THRILLED
AT THE NEWS, TOO.

00:18:17.552 --> 00:18:19.470
Shi-eun: THANK YOU FOR SAYING SO,

00:18:19.512 --> 00:18:21.097
AND CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE TRIALS.

00:18:21.139 --> 00:18:24.016
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
WHAT YOU LEARNED FROM YUUKI

00:18:24.058 --> 00:18:25.643
WILL BE USED TO HELP OTHERS.

00:18:25.685 --> 00:18:26.894
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

00:18:26.936 --> 00:18:28.354
Dr. Kurahashi: ME, TOO.

00:18:28.396 --> 00:18:31.357
YUUKI WAS THE FIRST PERSON
TO TEST THE MEDICUBOID,

00:18:31.399 --> 00:18:33.860
AND HER NAME
WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED.

00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:37.280
IF SHE WERE HERE,
SHE'D GET AN AWARD FOR HER HELP,

00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:39.782
ALONG WITH THE BENEFACTOR
WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE.

00:18:39.824 --> 00:18:41.325
Shi-eun: KNOWING YUUKI,

00:18:41.367 --> 00:18:43.661
SHE WOULDN'T BE TOO THRILLED
AT GETTING AN AWARD.

00:18:43.703 --> 00:18:45.663
SHE'D SAY,
"WHAT'S THE POINT IN HAVING IT

00:18:45.705 --> 00:18:46.748
IF I CAN'T EAT IT?"

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:48.750
All: (LAUGH)

00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:53.254
Asuna: UM, DOCTOR,
YOU JUST MENTIONED

00:18:53.296 --> 00:18:55.715
THE MEDICUBOID
HAD SOME KIND OF BENEFACTOR?

00:18:55.757 --> 00:18:56.883
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

00:18:56.924 --> 00:18:58.760
THE GOVERNMENT
WAS PAYING FOR IT.

00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:00.970
Dr. Kurahashi:
OH, WELL, YES, THEY ARE,

00:19:01.012 --> 00:19:02.305
BUT THE INITIAL DESIGNS

00:19:02.346 --> 00:19:04.682
WERE GIVEN TO US FOR FREE
FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

00:19:04.724 --> 00:19:06.768
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:10.646
I THINK HER NAME
WAS DR. RINKO KOUJIRO.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:13.733
Kazuto: (GASPS)

00:19:13.775 --> 00:19:16.194
Asuna: W‐WHAT'S WRONG, KIRITO?

00:19:16.235 --> 00:19:18.529
Kazuto: I‐‐I KNOW HER

00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:19.530
Asuna: HOW?

00:19:19.572 --> 00:19:21.699
Kazuto: I MET HER ONCE.

00:19:21.741 --> 00:19:24.076
YEAH, IN FACT,
SHE WAS TAKING CARE

00:19:24.118 --> 00:19:26.662
OF HEATHCLIFF'S BODY
WHILE HE WAS DIVING.

00:19:26.704 --> 00:19:28.498
SHE WAS HIS HEAD RESEARCHER.

00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:31.501
SHE HELPED HIM DEVELOP
FULL‐DIVE TECHNOLOGY.

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:34.337
YOU SEE?
THE MEDICUBOID'S DESIGN,

00:19:34.378 --> 00:19:36.005
YOU KNOW WHO INVENTED IT?

00:19:36.047 --> 00:19:37.924
Asuna: NO WAY.

00:19:37.965 --> 00:19:39.509
IT WAS KAYABA.

00:21:32.496 --> 00:21:34.457
Andrew: NEED ANY HELP
UNPACKING ALL THIS STUFF?

00:21:34.498 --> 00:21:36.417
Suguha: SURE,
BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE NOT BUSY.

00:21:36.459 --> 00:21:38.336
Tsuboi: SERIOUSLY,
AIN'T SHE CUTE?

00:21:38.377 --> 00:21:39.378
‐ Rika: UH...
‐ Ayano: UH...

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.088
Suguha: I GOT YOU A LITTLE GIFT.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.798
Shino: NO WAY.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.425
‐ Suguha: HEY...
‐ Tsuboi: YOU GUYS SUCK.

00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:46.802
Asuna: ARE YOU HAVING FUN
HANGING OUT HERE WITH EVERYONE?

00:21:46.844 --> 00:21:47.970
Yui: YES!

00:21:48.012 --> 00:21:49.597
AND THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS
ARE PRETTY.

00:21:49.639 --> 00:21:51.682
Kazuto: YEAH, IT'S TOO BAD
THEY'RE ALMOST GONE.

00:21:51.724 --> 00:21:52.934
Asuna: OH, PLEASE,

00:21:52.975 --> 00:21:54.268
THERE'S PLENTY LEFT,
YOU SPOILSPORT.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.270
ANYWAY, WE'RE HERE WITH YUI.

00:21:56.312 --> 00:21:58.022
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.

00:21:58.064 --> 00:22:00.775
Kazuto: I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
WE MADE IT HAPPEN THAT FAST.

00:22:00.816 --> 00:22:02.777
Yui: THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THIS, DADDY.

00:22:02.818 --> 00:22:04.070
Asuna: YEAH, KIRITO, THANK YOU.

00:22:04.111 --> 00:22:06.364
Kazuto: NAH, IF YOU WANT
TO THANK SOMEONE,

00:22:06.405 --> 00:22:09.033
THANK YUUKI
FOR HELPING ME DEVELOP IT.

00:22:11.744 --> 00:22:12.703
(WIND GUSTS)

00:22:12.745 --> 00:22:14.580
Yui: WOW!

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.918
Kazuto: THE REAL WORLD
AND THE VIRTUAL,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.253
I THOUGHT THE CLOSER
THEY CAME TOGETHER,

00:22:21.295 --> 00:22:22.922
THE BETTER THE FUTURE WOULD BE.

00:22:22.964 --> 00:22:24.173
Asuna: HM?

00:22:24.215 --> 00:22:26.258
Kazuto: IT'S LIKE
THE MORE THE LINES

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.677
BETWEEN THESE WORLDS BLUR,

00:22:27.718 --> 00:22:30.054
THE MORE EVERYONE
GETS SUCKED INTO ITS DARKNESS.

00:22:30.096 --> 00:22:34.767
Asuna: YEAH, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN HELPED BY IT, TOO.

00:22:34.809 --> 00:22:36.727
Kazuto: IF ANYTHING,

00:22:36.769 --> 00:22:40.189
I WISH I KNEW
WHAT KAYABA'S MASTER PLAN WAS.

00:22:40.231 --> 00:22:42.525
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT'S OUR JOB

00:22:42.566 --> 00:22:44.986
AS SURVIVORS OF S.A.O.
TO FIND OUT.

00:22:45.027 --> 00:22:46.946
Asuna: I THINK
YOU'RE OVERTHINKING THINGS.

00:22:46.988 --> 00:22:48.322
Kazuto: YEAH, I GUESS.

00:22:48.364 --> 00:22:51.575
STILL, I WANNA FIND OUT
MORE THAN EVER NOW.

00:22:51.617 --> 00:22:53.577
EVEN AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,

00:22:53.619 --> 00:22:55.496
MY CURIOSITY'S GOT ME HOOKED.

00:22:55.538 --> 00:22:58.833
ALTHOUGH, A PART OF ME
THINKS I'M BEING PLAYED HERE.

00:22:58.874 --> 00:23:00.126
THAT'S KIND OF ANNOYING.

00:23:01.335 --> 00:23:02.753
WHATEVER.

00:23:02.795 --> 00:23:05.673
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW.

00:23:05.715 --> 00:23:09.260
ALL I KNOW IS
I WANNA BE WITH YOU FOREVER,

00:23:09.301 --> 00:23:11.220
AND I WANT YOU TO BE WITH ME.

00:23:11.262 --> 00:23:12.930
Asuna: (LAUGHS)
I'LL STICK BY YOU,

00:23:12.972 --> 00:23:15.141
EVEN IF YOU MOVE
HALFWAY ACROSS THE PLANET.

00:23:15.182 --> 00:23:18.019
Kazuto: WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT MOVING?

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.354
Yui: DON'T FORGET
TO TAKE ME ALONG.

00:23:20.396 --> 00:23:22.606
Rika: HEY, LOVEBIRDS!

00:23:22.648 --> 00:23:25.568
QUIT MAKIN' OUT!
WE WANNA TAKE A PHOTO!

00:23:25.609 --> 00:23:27.820

00:23:27.862 --> 00:23:29.739
‐ Andrew: HURRY UP!

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.115
Kazuto: WELL, SHALL WE?

00:23:31.157 --> 00:23:32.116
Asuna: MM‐HMM.

00:23:32.158 --> 00:23:33.826
Yui: OKAY, DADDY.
