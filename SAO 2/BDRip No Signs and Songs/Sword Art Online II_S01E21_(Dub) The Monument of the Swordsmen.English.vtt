IT'S A BAD IDEA.

I DOUBT EVEN YOU CAN TAKE ON
A HORDE THIS BIG SOLO.

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.456
Kirito: YEAH, MAYBE.

00:00:33.497 --> 00:00:36.083

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.715
YOU TAUGHT ME SOMETHING
I'M ALWAYS GOING TO REMEMBER.

00:08:19.757 --> 00:08:23.177

Asuna: I KNEW IT.
THAT WASN'T RANDOM.

00:11:19.188 --> 00:11:21.565
IT'S PROTECTING A CRITICAL
WEAK SPOT WITH THAT MOVE.

00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.031
Asuna: AT THE VERY LEAST,

00:11:29.072 --> 00:11:30.741
WE'LL PUT A DENT IN ITS H.P.

00:11:30.782 --> 00:11:33.410
THING IS,
IT'S TOO HIGH UP TO REACH,

JUST USE OUR SWORD SKILLS

AND KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR COUNTERMOVES.

00:11:38.957 --> 00:11:40.250

00:11:40.292 --> 00:11:42.377

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:56.428
Jun: WE DID IT.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.722

00:14:34.883 --> 00:14:36.093
Asuna: GREAT JOB, YOU GUYS!

I'M KIND OF SAD IT'S OVER.

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:41.056
Siune: OH, IT'S NOT OVER YET.

00:14:41.098 --> 00:14:42.349
Asuna: HUH?

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.809
Siune: THERE'S
ONE LAST THING TO DO.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:44.810
Asuna: UM...

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.062
Siune: YOU KNOW, A PARTY?

00:14:47.104 --> 00:14:48.814
Asuna: OH!

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:50.023
(LAUGHS) OF COURSE!

00:14:50.065 --> 00:14:51.858
(LAUGHS)

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.360
LET'S HAVE A BIG ONE.

00:14:53.401 --> 00:14:55.195
WE'LL PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS.

00:14:55.237 --> 00:14:57.864
Jun: SWEET! WE GOT ENOUGH NOW
TO PARTY IN STYLE, RIGHT?

00:14:57.906 --> 00:14:58.865
Tecchi: MM‐HMM.

00:14:58.907 --> 00:15:00.283
Jun: WHERE ARE WE GONNA HAVE IT?

00:15:00.325 --> 00:15:02.452
HEY, WE SHOULD GO
TO SOME BIG CITY

00:15:02.494 --> 00:15:04.079
AND BUY OUT A RESTAURANT
FOR THE NIGHT.

00:15:04.121 --> 00:15:05.789
‐ Asuna: UM...

00:15:05.831 --> 00:15:08.375
Asuna: ACTUALLY,
IF YOU GUYS WANT TO,

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:11.002
WE COULD HAVE IT
AT MY PLACE IN‐GAME.

00:15:11.044 --> 00:15:12.754
IT'S SMALL, BUT COZY.

00:15:12.796 --> 00:15:14.339
Yuuki: REALLY?!

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:15.841
OH.

00:15:15.882 --> 00:15:19.761
Asuna: Y‐YUUKI,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

00:15:19.803 --> 00:15:21.429
Yuuki: UM...

00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:23.890
Siune: PLEASE FORGIVE US, ASUNA.

00:15:23.932 --> 00:15:26.893
WE REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR OFFER TO HOST THE PARTY.

00:15:26.935 --> 00:15:29.104
IT'S JUST THAT...

00:15:42.993 --> 00:15:45.162
OH, NEVER MIND. IT'S NOTHING.

00:15:45.203 --> 00:15:47.664
WE'D BE HONORED
TO HAVE OUR VICTORY PARTY

00:15:47.706 --> 00:15:48.915
AT YOUR HOME, ASUNA.

00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:52.586
Nori: THAT SETTLES IT.

00:15:52.627 --> 00:15:55.630
GUYS, WE'RE HEADING OVER
TO THE LOMBARD CENTRAL MARKET.

00:15:55.672 --> 00:15:57.841
WE GOT OURSELVES
SOME SHOPPING TO DO.

00:15:57.883 --> 00:15:59.467
Tecchi: HELL TO THE YES!

00:15:59.509 --> 00:16:01.636
Jun: LET'S GET SOME OF THAT ALE!

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:07.811
Yuuki: WOW.

00:16:07.852 --> 00:16:10.563
YOUR PLACE IS SO COOL, ASUNA.

00:16:12.148 --> 00:16:14.317
WAIT. THERE'S ALREADY
FOOD AND DRINKS OUT.

00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:15.944
Talken: WHOA.

00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:17.737
Tecchi: NOW THAT'S
WHAT I'M TALKING 'BOUT!

00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:19.656

Tecchi: I'M GONNA DIG IN, OKAY?

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.160
Nori: PUT THOSE
OVER THERE, YEAH?

00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:30.875
Asuna: (CHUCKLES)

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:38.925
Nori: YOU'RE NOT SCARED
OF A LITTLE ALKIE‐HOL, ARE YA?

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:41.261
Talken: NO!
I JUST WANNA PACE MYSELF.

00:16:41.302 --> 00:16:45.306
Yuuki: OKAY, SO THE WORST M.M.O.
I EVER PLAYED WAS...

00:16:45.348 --> 00:16:47.892
THIS ONE FROM THE U.S.
CALLED INSEC‐SITE.

00:16:47.934 --> 00:16:49.644
Siune: (SHUDDERS)
THAT ONE'S BAD.

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:51.813
Asuna: REALLY?
WHY DIDN'T YOU LIKE IT?

00:16:51.855 --> 00:16:53.106
Yuuki: BUGS EVERYWHERE!

00:16:53.148 --> 00:16:55.650
IF IT WERE JUST THE MONSTERS,
NO PROBLEM,

00:16:55.692 --> 00:16:57.694
BUT YOU GOTTA PLAY AS A BUG!

00:16:57.736 --> 00:16:59.863
I HAD TO PLAY AS A BIPEDAL ANT,

00:16:59.904 --> 00:17:02.157
SO I GUESS
I DIDN'T HAVE IT TOO BAD,

00:17:02.198 --> 00:17:03.825
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HER.

00:17:03.867 --> 00:17:06.035
Siune: (GASPS) NO!
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING!

00:17:06.077 --> 00:17:08.037
Yuuki: SHE WAS
A GIANT CATERPILLAR!

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.831
SPITTIN' SILK LIKE WHOO!

00:17:09.873 --> 00:17:11.833
‐ (LAUGHS)
‐ Siune: (GROANS)

00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:14.544
Asuna: (LAUGHS) THAT'S AWESOME.

00:17:14.586 --> 00:17:16.546
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT TO TRAVEL

00:17:16.588 --> 00:17:18.381
TO SOME REALLY COOL PLACES
TOGETHER.

00:17:18.423 --> 00:17:21.134
Yuuki: HOW 'BOUT YOU?
I MEAN, YOU COME OFF

00:17:21.176 --> 00:17:23.261
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING
V.R.M.M.O. s FOREVER.

00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:24.262
Asuna: DO I?

00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:26.890
WELL, I PLAY THIS ONE A LOT.

00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:29.601
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY HOURS IT TOOK

00:17:29.642 --> 00:17:31.936
TO GET THE MONEY
TO BUY THIS CABIN.

00:17:31.978 --> 00:17:33.271
Yuuki: WORTH IT.

00:17:33.313 --> 00:17:36.566
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SAID
THIS PLACE WAS COZY,

00:17:36.608 --> 00:17:37.984
YOU WEREN'T KIDDING.

00:17:38.026 --> 00:17:41.488
IT'S GOT THIS REALLY COOL
OLD‐TIMEY VIBE.

00:17:41.529 --> 00:17:43.198
Siune: YES, IT DOES.

00:17:43.239 --> 00:17:46.242
IT'S SO PEACEFUL,
I COULD SIT HERE ALL DAY.

00:17:46.284 --> 00:17:47.619
(GASPS)

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.871
Asuna: W‐WHAT'S WRONG, SIUNE?

00:17:49.913 --> 00:17:52.277
I'M SO SORRY,
BUT I JUST REMEMBERED.

00:17:52.318 --> 00:17:54.028
WHEN WE ASKED YOU TO HELP,

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.906
WE SAID WE'D GIVE YOU WHATEVER
THE BOSS DROPPED IN RETURN.

00:17:56.948 --> 00:17:58.491
IT WAS MONEY, THOUGH,

00:17:58.533 --> 00:18:02.287
AND WE SPENT A LOT OF IT ON FOOD
AND DRINK FOR OUR PARTY.

00:18:03.997 --> 00:18:06.499
Talken: WHAT HAVE WE DONE?

00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:09.002
‐ Sleeping Knights: (GROAN)
‐ Talken: AW, MAN.

00:18:09.043 --> 00:18:12.839
Yuuki: CRAP! NOW WE DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO GIVE YOU.

00:18:12.881 --> 00:18:14.215
Asuna: NO, IT'S OKAY.

00:18:15.425 --> 00:18:17.844
HOW ABOUT A FAVOR INSTEAD?

00:18:17.886 --> 00:18:19.429
Yuuki: FAVOR?

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.264
Asuna: UH‐HUH.

00:18:21.306 --> 00:18:24.184
HONESTLY, I'M A LITTLE SAD
THE QUEST IS OVER.

00:18:25.435 --> 00:18:27.937
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU
BETTER, YUUKI.

00:18:27.979 --> 00:18:30.732
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

00:18:30.773 --> 00:18:32.233
Yuuki: ASUNA,

00:18:32.275 --> 00:18:35.278
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA FIGHT
TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS.

00:18:38.156 --> 00:18:39.449
Asuna: YUUKI...

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.951
WOULD YOU LET ME JOIN
THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS?

00:18:41.993 --> 00:18:44.120
Sleeping Knights: (GASP)

00:18:50.543 --> 00:18:53.796
Yuuki: ASUNA,
I WISH YOU COULD, BUT...

00:18:53.838 --> 00:18:58.009
IT'S LIKE THIS IS
A TEMPORARY THING FOR US,

00:18:58.051 --> 00:19:01.304
AND, LIKE, COME SPRING,
WE'LL BE SPLITTING UP,

00:19:01.346 --> 00:19:02.722
AND AFTER THAT,

00:19:02.764 --> 00:19:06.059
I DOUBT ANY OF US'LL
BE DIVING MUCH ANY MORE.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.811
Asuna: I KNOW,
BUT CAN I JOIN UNTIL THEN?

00:19:08.853 --> 00:19:10.605
I WANT US TO BE FRIENDS.

00:19:10.647 --> 00:19:13.191
I WANT TO BE FRIENDS
WITH ALL OF YOU.

00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:15.276
THERE'S STILL ENOUGH TIME
FOR THAT, ISN'T THERE?

00:19:17.111 --> 00:19:20.823
Yuuki: I‐I'M SORRY, ASUNA.

00:19:20.865 --> 00:19:23.034
YOU CAN'T. SORRY.

00:19:24.744 --> 00:19:27.205
Asuna: NOT AT ALL. IT'S FINE.

00:19:27.247 --> 00:19:29.916
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUT YOU
ON THE SPOT LIKE THAT, YUUKI.

00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:30.959
I'M SORRY.

00:19:32.335 --> 00:19:34.921
Siune: UM, ASUNA,

00:19:34.963 --> 00:19:37.882
I DON'T‐‐YOU SEE, WE‐‐

00:19:37.924 --> 00:19:40.426

Siune: WHAT?

00:19:46.015 --> 00:19:48.017
Asuna: THE REASON
WE BEAT THE BOSS, REMEMBER?

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:50.687
YOU KNOW, THE MONUMENT
IN THE BLACK IRON PALACE.

00:19:50.728 --> 00:19:52.772
I'M SURE
IT'S BEEN UPDATED BY NOW.

00:19:52.814 --> 00:19:55.233
Jun: YEAH, GUYS! LET'S GO! OH.

00:19:56.651 --> 00:19:58.444
