WEBVTT

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:24.948
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.205
Siune: ASUNA.

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:35.791
Asuna: (GASPS) SIUNE.

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.044
PLEASE, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO YUUKI?

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:40.921
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS,
AND SHE HASN'T LOGGED BACK IN.

00:00:40.963 --> 00:00:42.715
Siune: IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:46.051
NONE OF US HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO CONTACT HER EITHER.

00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:48.429
ASUNA, I HATE TO SAY THIS,

00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:51.682
BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:54.101
I THINK SHE'S DOING IT
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:56.145
Asuna: (GASPS) BUT WHY?

00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:03.819
I HAD A FEELING
SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.

00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:06.655
I COULD TELL
EVERYONE IN THE GROUP

00:01:06.697 --> 00:01:08.616
WAS AVOIDING
GETTING TOO CLOSE TO ME.

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:12.411
THE LAST THING I WANT
IS TO UPSET ANYONE

00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:14.205
OR BE A NUISANCE.

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:18.709
BUT STILL, I DON'T SEE HOW ANY
OF THIS COULD BE FOR MY SAKE!

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.377
Siune: YOU'RE NOT A NUISANCE!

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:23.255
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY

00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:25.633
WE'RE ALL TRULY HAPPY
TO HAVE MET YOU.

00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:28.427
WE GOT TO HAVE
ONE LAST AMAZING MEMORY

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.348
OF OUR TIME TOGETHER HERE,
AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU.

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:35.476
AND YUUKI,
I KNOW SHE'S GRATEFUL, TOO,

00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:38.646
BUT PLEASE,
FORGET YOU EVER MET US.

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:42.733
IT REALLY IS THE BEST THING
FOR YOU AND FOR YUUKI.

00:01:42.775 --> 00:01:45.611
Asuna: I CAN'T EVER SEE
ANY OF YOU AGAIN?

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:48.906
I THOUGHT
AFTER THE GUILD WAS GONE,

00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:51.826
I THOUGHT WE COULD AT LEAST
KEEP ON BEING FRIENDS,

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:53.994
BUT THIS WHOLE TIME,

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:55.704
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO THOUGHT THAT?

00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:58.582
Siune: I'M SORRY.

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:02.586
Asuna: NO, WAIT!

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.379
Rika: ASUNA!

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:09.298
MORNING.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.758
Ayano: MORNING, ASUNA.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.884
Asuna: GOOD MORNING.

00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:13.970
Rika: AH,
WE FINALLY CAUGHT YOU.

00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:15.388
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HERE,

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:17.515
SO YOU GONNA TELL US
WHAT THAT MESSAGE WAS ABOUT?

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:18.849
Ayano: IS IT TRUE?

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.685
LIZ SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU JOINING A GUILD.

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:22.061
‐ Asuna: (GASPS)
‐ Lisbeth: COME ON.

00:04:22.103 --> 00:04:23.980
COME ON, TELL US. ARE THEY COOL?

00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:25.106
Asuna: WELL, IT'S LIKE‐‐

00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:26.565
(RINGTONE CHIMING)

00:04:26.607 --> 00:04:28.442
OH, HANG ON A SEC.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:31.237
HUH?

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.490
Kazuto: ALL RIGHT, HOW'S THAT?

00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:36.284
CAN YOU SEE MY FACE OKAY?

00:04:36.325 --> 00:04:39.203
Yui: I SEE YOU,
BUT YOU'RE A LITTLE BLURRY.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.831
Kazuto: HMM.
IT'S THE AUTOFOCUS AGAIN.

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:43.332
IT'S GOTTA BE THAT.

00:04:43.374 --> 00:04:44.959
GIVE ME A SEC, YUI.

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:46.002
Yui: OKAY, DADDY.

00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:58.681
Kazuto: HEY.

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.566
THIS ZEKKEN,
YOU STILL WANT TO SEE HER?

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:09.817
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:12.445
MM‐HMM.

00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:14.780
Kazuto: EVEN AFTER THEY SAY
IT'S BETTER YOU DIDN'T,

00:05:14.822 --> 00:05:15.781
YOU STILL DO?

00:05:15.823 --> 00:05:16.782
Asuna: MM‐HMM.

00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:18.284
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY.

00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:21.037
ALL I WANT IS TO TALK
TO YUUKI ONE LAST TIME.

00:05:21.078 --> 00:05:22.538
I CAN'T LEAVE IT LIKE THIS.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.873
Kazuto: OKAY.

00:05:26.751 --> 00:05:29.211
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE FOUND
WHERE SHE'S AT.

00:05:29.253 --> 00:05:31.672
I'M NOT SURE,
BUT IT'S THE BEST I GOT.

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:33.674
Asuna: WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SHE'D BE HERE?

00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:35.801
Kazuto: THAT PLACE HAS
A MEDICUBOID.

00:05:35.843 --> 00:05:39.138
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES DOING
THE CLINICAL TRIALS FOR IT.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.432
Asuna: MEDICUBOID?

00:05:52.693 --> 00:05:53.652
EXCUSE ME.

00:05:53.694 --> 00:05:54.737
Receptionist: MAY I HELP YOU?

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.072
Asuna: YES.

00:05:56.113 --> 00:05:59.075
I, UM‐‐I THINK
I'M LOOKING FOR A PATIENT.

00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:00.534
Receptionist: UH...

00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:03.037
Asuna: WELL, SHE'S ABOUT
15 YEARS OLD OR SO.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.915
I THINK HER NAME MIGHT BE YUUKI,
BUT I'M NOT SURE.

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:07.833
Receptionist:
I NEED A NAME AT LEAST.

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.795
Asuna: OH. UM, WELL, I THINK
SHE MIGHT BE THE PATIENT

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:13.631
WHO'S TESTING
THAT MEDICUBOID THING.

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:14.965
Second receptionist:
PARDON ME, MISS.

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:15.966
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:17.551
Asuna: UH, OH, SORRY.

00:06:17.593 --> 00:06:19.428
MY NAME IS ASUNA YUUKI.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.763
Second receptionist: (GASPS)

00:06:20.805 --> 00:06:22.556
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:24.225
I'LL GET SOMEONE RIGHT AWAY.

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:25.351
Asuna: UM, SURE.

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:31.190
(FOOTSTEPS)

00:06:31.232 --> 00:06:33.692
Doctor: HI. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:35.694
I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN WAITING LONG.

00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:37.154
Asuna: NO, NOT AT ALL.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.280
Doctor: THAT'S GOOD.

00:06:38.322 --> 00:06:40.074
THEY TOLD ME YOU'RE ASUNA YUUKI.

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:41.242
Asuna: YES.

00:06:41.283 --> 00:06:43.119
Doctor: GREAT.
I'M DR. KURAHASHI.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.287
I'M YUUKI KONNO'S
PRIMARY PHYSICIAN.

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:47.289
Asuna: YUUKI KONNO.

00:06:49.502 --> 00:06:50.545
Dr. Kurahashi: YOU KNOW,

00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:51.754
I'M SURPRISED YOU EVEN FOUND US.

00:06:51.796 --> 00:06:53.131
Asuna: WHY?

00:06:53.172 --> 00:06:54.966
Dr. Kurahashi: OH,
WELL, WE KEEP A LOW PROFILE.

00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:56.759
THAT SAID, YUUKI WARNED ME
SOMEONE CALLED ASUNA

00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:59.220
MIGHT TRY AND PAY HER A VISIT
AT SOME POINT.

00:06:59.262 --> 00:07:00.388
Asuna: SHE WARNED YOU?

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:02.140
Dr. Kurahashi: UH‐HUH.
SHE ALSO SAID

00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:04.058
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHERE SHE WAS,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.726
SO I SAID,
"DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT."

00:07:05.768 --> 00:07:07.353
SHE'S NOT GONNA FIND YOU HERE."

00:07:09.397 --> 00:07:12.066
WHEN RECEPTION TOLD ME
YOU WERE IN THE LOBBY,

00:07:12.108 --> 00:07:13.442
I WAS SHOCKED.

00:07:13.484 --> 00:07:16.112
Asuna: DOCTOR, HAS YUUKI
TOLD YOU ANYTHING ELSE

00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:18.114
ABOUT ME OR HOW WE MET?

00:07:18.156 --> 00:07:19.782
Dr. Kurahashi: I'LL SAY SHE HAS.

00:07:19.824 --> 00:07:22.618
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH
THE ONLY PERSON SHE TALKS ABOUT.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.080
ALTHOUGH, IT SEEMS
WHENEVER YUUKI DOES MENTION YOU,

00:07:26.122 --> 00:07:28.082
SHE ALWAYS ENDS UP IN TEARS.

00:07:28.124 --> 00:07:29.500
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:07:29.542 --> 00:07:31.752
Dr. Kurahashi: SHE'S ALWAYS
BEEN A BRAVE GIRL

00:07:31.794 --> 00:07:33.588
AND NEVER FELT SORRY
FOR HERSELF.

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:35.131
SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU,

00:07:35.173 --> 00:07:37.842
BUT SHE CAN'T BRING HERSELF
TO DO IT.

00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:40.428
Asuna: YES, I KNOW,

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:42.763
AND I STILL CAN'T WRAP
MY HEAD AROUND IT.

00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:46.475
A FRIEND OF HERS TOLD ME IN‐GAME
THAT IT WAS FOR MY OWN GOOD.

00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:47.476
WHY IS THAT?

00:07:47.518 --> 00:07:49.520
WHY CAN'T WE SEE EACH OTHER?

00:07:55.651 --> 00:07:57.320
Dr. Kurahashi: FOR STARTERS,

00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:00.239
I SHOULD TELL YOU
WHAT THE MEDICUBOID IS ABOUT.

00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:01.532
Asuna: OKAY.

00:08:01.574 --> 00:08:04.076
Dr. Kurahashi:
MEDICUBOID IS THE CODE NAME

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:06.746
FOR THE WORLD'S FIRST
MEDICAL FULL‐DIVE MACHINE.

00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:08.456
IT'S SO REVOLUTIONARY,

00:08:08.497 --> 00:08:10.166
THE GOVERNMENT'S
BACKING ITS DEVELOPMENT.

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:12.460
Asuna: IT'S A FULL‐DIVE RIG
FOR HOSPITALS?

00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:13.461
Dr. Kurahashi: UH‐HUH.

00:08:13.502 --> 00:08:14.879
FOR EXAMPLE,

00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:16.631
LET'S SAY YOU WERE A PATIENT

00:08:16.672 --> 00:08:18.716
WITH A VISUAL
OR HEARING DISABILITY.

00:08:18.758 --> 00:08:21.385
THIS MACHINE
CAN GIVE YOU BACK THOSE SENSES.

00:08:21.427 --> 00:08:23.137
YOU KNOW HOW
WITH THE AMUSPHERE RIG

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:26.807
IMAGES AND SOUNDS GET SENT
DIRECTLY TO YOUR BRAIN?

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.519
WELL, TRANSMITTING SIGNALS
ISN'T ALL IT DOES.

00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:32.355
THE AMUSPHERE HAS THE ABILITY

00:08:32.396 --> 00:08:34.523
TO CANCEL OUT
PHYSICAL SENSATIONS, TOO.

00:08:34.565 --> 00:08:37.777
BACK HERE, IT HITS THAT SPOT
WITH ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES,

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:40.279
SO IT TEMPORARILY
NUMBS THE NERVES.

00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:43.115
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A GENERAL ANESTHETIC.

00:08:43.157 --> 00:08:46.077
Asuna: OKAY, BUT HOW IS THAT
USEFUL FOR HOSPITALS?

00:08:46.118 --> 00:08:49.664
THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH
THE AMUSPHERE CAN BLOCK OUT.

00:08:49.705 --> 00:08:52.083
WHAT HAPPENS IF A PATIENT'S
IN SERIOUS PAIN?

00:08:52.124 --> 00:08:53.209
Dr. Kurahashi: EXACTLY.

00:08:53.251 --> 00:08:55.378
YOU HIT THE NAIL
RIGHT ON THE HEAD.

00:08:55.419 --> 00:08:56.754
THE AMUSPHERE CAN'T DO IT.

00:08:56.796 --> 00:08:58.673
EVEN THE NERVEGEAR
CAN'T BLOCK PAIN

00:08:58.714 --> 00:09:00.299
FROM SURGERY OR CHRONIC ILLNESS.

00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:04.262
HOWEVER, THE MEDICUBOID ENHANCES
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE.

00:09:04.303 --> 00:09:07.598
PLUS IT'S BUILT INTO THE BED,
SO THERE'S MORE COVERAGE,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.100
THE BRAIN, SPINE, EVERYTHING.

00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:10.851
ONCE IT GETS ON THE MARKET,

00:09:10.893 --> 00:09:13.771
IT'LL CHANGE THE COURSE
OF MEDICINE AS WE KNOW IT.

00:09:13.813 --> 00:09:15.398
THE MEDICUBOID
HAS INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL.

00:09:15.439 --> 00:09:18.067
YOU COULD, SAY,
PAIR IT WITH A CAMERA

00:09:18.109 --> 00:09:19.819
AND GIVE IT AN A.R. FUNCTION.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.238
THE PATIENT GETS
REAL‐WORLD IMAGES IN REAL TIME.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.656
Asuna: THAT'S GREAT.

00:09:23.698 --> 00:09:26.492
SOUNDS MORE LIKE A MIRACLE
THAN A MACHINE TO ME.

00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:31.622
Dr. Kurahashi: YES.
IN A WAY, IT IS A MIRACLE.

00:09:33.374 --> 00:09:38.045
EVEN SO, CURING ILLNESS
IS SOMETHING IT CAN'T DO.

00:09:38.087 --> 00:09:41.257
THE MEDICUBOID
IS MAKING AN IMPACT, THOUGH,

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:43.926
WE HOPE, IN TERMINAL CARE.

00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:46.137
Asuna: TERMINAL CARE?

00:09:46.178 --> 00:09:47.430
Dr. Kurahashi: YES.

00:09:47.471 --> 00:09:49.849
IT'S HELPING
PATIENTS WHO ARE DYING.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.268
Asuna: (GASPS) SHE'S DYING?

00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:55.062
Dr. Kurahashi: YUUKI TOLD ME

00:09:55.104 --> 00:09:57.106
THAT IF YOU
REALLY WANTED TO HEAR

00:09:57.148 --> 00:10:00.901
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER,
I COULD GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU,

00:10:00.943 --> 00:10:04.155
BUT I HAVE TO WARN YOU,
IT'S NOT A PLEASANT STORY.

00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:05.489
YOU'RE GOING TO WISH

00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:07.491
THIS CONVERSATION ENDED
RIGHT HERE.

00:10:11.287 --> 00:10:12.872
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:14.665
NO...

00:10:14.707 --> 00:10:17.335
I WANT TO HEAR IT,
THE WHOLE THING,

00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:20.046
AND I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
UNTIL YOU TELL ME.

00:10:24.844 --> 00:10:27.805
Dr. Kurahashi:
YUUKI WAS BORN IN MAY OF 2011,

00:10:27.847 --> 00:10:29.431
BUT THERE WERE COMPLICATIONS,

00:10:29.473 --> 00:10:32.601
AND THE DOCTORS HAD TO GIVE
HER MOTHER A C‐SECTION.

00:10:32.643 --> 00:10:34.603
HER MOTHER WAS GIVEN
A TRANSFUSION

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:36.605
DURING THE PROCEDURE,

00:10:36.647 --> 00:10:39.108
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
THE BLOOD THEY USED

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.569
‐ WAS CONTAMINATED WITH A VIRUS.
‐ Asuna: (GASPS)

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.445
Dr. Kurahashi: THEY DIDN'T
FIND OUT ABOUT IT

00:10:43.487 --> 00:10:45.698
UNTIL SEPTEMBER, WHEN HER MOTHER

00:10:45.739 --> 00:10:48.617
WAS HAVING TESTS RUN
FOR AN INFECTION SHE GOT.

00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:50.327
BUT BY THAT TIME,

00:10:50.369 --> 00:10:52.246
THE WHOLE FAMILY'D
BEEN INFECTED.

00:11:02.214 --> 00:11:03.299
THIS WAY.

00:11:06.302 --> 00:11:08.012
WE HAVE TO KEEP THE ROOM

00:11:08.053 --> 00:11:10.431
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS
HERMETICALLY SEALED,

00:11:10.472 --> 00:11:12.850
SO THIS IS
AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET.

00:11:12.892 --> 00:11:14.226
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:11:15.477 --> 00:11:16.645
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:26.780
YUUKI.

00:11:26.822 --> 00:11:30.576
DOCTOR, WHAT KIND OF ILLNESS
DOES YUUKI HAVE?

00:11:30.618 --> 00:11:33.454
Dr. Kurahashi: ACQUIRED
IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME,

00:11:33.495 --> 00:11:34.538
AIDS FOR SHORT.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.998
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.335
Dr. Kurahashi: IT'S CAUSED
BY THE H.I.V. VIRUS.

00:11:39.376 --> 00:11:41.003
IT'S SCARY, BUT THERE'S HOPE,

00:11:41.045 --> 00:11:43.672
BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE
WHO HAS IT DEVELOPS AIDS.

00:11:43.714 --> 00:11:47.676
IF YOU CAN TREAT H.I.V. EARLY,
YOU CAN HAVE A LONG LIFE.

00:11:47.718 --> 00:11:49.136
(LENS WHIRS)

00:11:49.178 --> 00:11:50.638
IN HER FAMILY'S CASE,

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:52.640
THE VIRUS
WAS DIFFICULT TO TREAT.

00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:54.642
IT'S A DRUG‐RESISTANT STRAIN.

00:11:54.683 --> 00:11:56.310
WHEN HER MOTHER FOUND OUT,

00:11:56.352 --> 00:11:58.938
SHE GOT SO UPSET
OVER HER CHILDREN'S FATE,

00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:00.272
SHE ACTUALLY CONSIDERED

00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:02.733
KILLING THE WHOLE FAMILY
ALONG WITH HERSELF.

00:12:03.943 --> 00:12:06.111
BUT THEN SHE CHANGED HER MIND

00:12:06.153 --> 00:12:08.447
AND DECIDED
TO FIGHT THE DISEASE INSTEAD.

00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:10.532
Asuna: SHE FOUGHT IT

00:12:10.574 --> 00:12:12.493
FOR HER KIDS.

00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:15.496
Dr. Kurahashi: YES.
SOON AFTER THEY WERE DIAGNOSED,

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:18.374
YUUKI WAS PUT ON A MULTIDRUG
COURSE OF THERAPY,

00:12:18.415 --> 00:12:20.251
BUT IT'S HARD FOR A CHILD

00:12:20.292 --> 00:12:22.586
TO HAVE TO TAKE
SO MANY DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS

00:12:22.628 --> 00:12:23.921
AND KEEP TAKING THEM.

00:12:23.963 --> 00:12:26.298
THE SIDE‐EFFECTS ARE ONE THING.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.175
THE OTHER, BEING SHUNNED

00:12:28.217 --> 00:12:30.511
BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND
HER CONDITION.

00:12:30.552 --> 00:12:32.513
STILL, YUUKI WAS A TROUPER.

00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:34.515
SHE BELIEVED HER
AND HER FAMILY

00:12:34.556 --> 00:12:37.017
WOULD GET BETTER EVENTUALLY.

00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:40.437
HOWEVER, WHEN SHE
WAS IN THE FOURTH GRADE,

00:12:40.479 --> 00:12:42.481
HER IMMUNE SYSTEM
SUDDENLY COLLAPSED,

00:12:42.523 --> 00:12:45.526
AND THEN SHE WAS BROUGHT
TO THIS HOSPITAL,

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:48.195
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE
WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AIDS.

00:12:48.237 --> 00:12:49.655
Asuna: (SHUDDERS)

00:12:49.697 --> 00:12:51.156
Dr. Kurahashi: BUT LIKE I SAID,

00:12:51.198 --> 00:12:52.283
SHE'S A TROUPER.

00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:53.784
SHE NEVER ONCE LOST
HER OPTIMISM.

00:12:55.202 --> 00:12:57.204
Asuna: DOCTOR...

00:12:57.246 --> 00:12:58.455
Dr. Kurahashi: HMM?

00:12:58.497 --> 00:13:00.499
Asuna: WHY IS SHE USING
THE MEDICUBOID?

00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:02.793
Dr. Kurahashi: I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY IT ALL STARTED

00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:05.838
BACK WHEN EVERYONE WAS PANICKING
OVER THAT NERVEGEAR INCIDENT.

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:07.172
THEY HAD JUST COMPLETED

00:13:07.214 --> 00:13:09.550
THE FIRST PROTOTYPE
OF THE MEDICUBOID.

00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:12.094
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES
IT PUT OUT

00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:14.388
WERE MANY TIMES STRONGER
THAN THE NERVEGEAR'S.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.974
THAT WAS A PROBLEM,
SINCE NO ONE KNEW

00:13:17.016 --> 00:13:19.018
WHAT THE LONG‐TERM EFFECTS
OF EXPOSURE WERE.

00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:21.603
BECAUSE OF THAT,
THEY COULDN'T FIND A PATIENT

00:13:21.645 --> 00:13:24.732
WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK,
SO ITS TRIAL RUN WAS STALLED.

00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:26.817
WHEN I FOUND OUT,

00:13:26.859 --> 00:13:28.569
I THOUGHT
ABOUT YUUKI'S SITUATION,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.237
AND I CONTACTED HER PARENTS.

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:32.239
IF SHE WERE THE TEST SUBJECT,

00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:34.616
SHE'D BE MOVED
TO THE MEDICUBOID STERILE ROOM.

00:13:34.658 --> 00:13:37.369
SHE'D RUN LESS OF A RISK
OF GETTING AN INFECTION.

00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:40.372
I TOLD THEM IT WAS
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:13:40.414 --> 00:13:42.416
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

00:13:42.458 --> 00:13:46.837
BUT HONESTLY, I STILL DON'T KNOW
IF I WAS RIGHT TO SUGGEST IT.

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:50.174
GOD KNOWS WHAT IT WAS LIKE
FOR YUUKI AND HER PARENTS,

00:13:50.215 --> 00:13:52.259
THINKING ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT.

00:13:52.301 --> 00:13:55.054
BUT I THINK
THE LURE OF THE UNKNOWN,

00:13:55.095 --> 00:13:58.515
THE VIRTUAL WORLD WAS
THE DECIDING FACTOR FOR YUUKI,

00:13:58.557 --> 00:14:02.186
SO THAT BRAVE LITTLE GIRL
AGREED TO BE A TEST SUBJECT,

00:14:02.227 --> 00:14:03.812
AND THEY MOVED HER IN.

00:14:03.854 --> 00:14:07.649
SHE'S LIVED INSIDE
THE MEDICUBOID EVER SINCE.

00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:09.526
Asuna: YOU MEAN
SHE'S NEVER COME OUT?

00:14:09.568 --> 00:14:11.153
Dr. Kurahashi: NO, SHE HASN'T.

00:14:11.195 --> 00:14:12.488
YUUKI STAYS LOGGED IN

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:15.365
AND RARELY SPENDS ANY TIME
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:14:15.407 --> 00:14:17.493
SHE'S ALWAYS IN A LOT OF PAIN,

00:14:17.534 --> 00:14:19.286
BUT THANKS TO THE MEDICUBOID'S
SENSATION CANCELER,

00:14:19.328 --> 00:14:21.080
SHE CAN BLOCK IT OUT.

00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:25.459
Asuna: SO WAIT. YOU MEAN SHE'S
IN A CONTINUOUS, 24‐HOUR DIVE?

00:14:25.501 --> 00:14:26.710
SINCE WHEN?

00:14:26.752 --> 00:14:29.046
Dr. Kurahashi:
FOR THREE YEARS NOW.

00:14:29.088 --> 00:14:32.841
Asuna: THAT'S A WHOLE YEAR
LONGER THAN US.

00:14:32.883 --> 00:14:35.177
Kirito: IT FELT
LIKE THEY WERE A PRODUCT

00:14:35.219 --> 00:14:37.012
OF THE FULL‐DIVE
ENVIRONMENT ITSELF.

00:14:54.988 --> 00:14:56.365
Asuna: THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

00:14:57.449 --> 00:14:59.785
I'M GLAD I GOT TO SEE HER AGAIN.

00:15:01.411 --> 00:15:03.997
SHE'LL BE OKAY
AS LONG AS SHE'S HERE, RIGHT?

00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:06.834
Dr. Kurahashi: WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR HER,

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:09.002
BUT EVEN IF THE ROOM IS STERILE,

00:15:09.044 --> 00:15:11.713
THERE'S NO WAY TO ELIMINATE
THE VIRUS THAT'S INSIDE HER.

00:15:11.755 --> 00:15:13.257
Asuna: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:15:13.298 --> 00:15:15.676
Dr. Kurahashi: YUUKI DOESN'T
HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT.

00:15:15.717 --> 00:15:17.177
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:15:17.219 --> 00:15:19.346
Dr. Kurahashi: AND THAT'S
MOST LIKELY THE REASON

00:15:19.388 --> 00:15:23.308
WHY SHE TRIED CUTTING TIES
WITH YOU THE WAY SHE DID.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.643
Asuna: THAT'S WHY SHE...

00:15:24.685 --> 00:15:26.687
YUUKI!

00:15:26.728 --> 00:15:30.149
Yuuki: ASUNA, I‐‐I...

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.651
(LAUGHS) WE DID IT!

00:15:32.693 --> 00:15:34.278
LEAVE IT TO ME, SIS!

00:15:34.319 --> 00:15:35.362
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:15:35.404 --> 00:15:38.240
UM, DOCTOR, I WAS WONDERING,

00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:40.242
DOES YUUKI HAVE AN OLDER SISTER?

00:15:40.284 --> 00:15:42.661
Dr. Kurahashi:
UH, YES, ACTUALLY,

00:15:42.703 --> 00:15:44.955
A TWIN SISTER, TO BE PRECISE.

00:15:46.165 --> 00:15:47.332
HER NAME'S AIKO,

00:15:47.374 --> 00:15:49.501
AND SHE WAS BORN
A FEW MINUTES EARLIER.

00:15:49.543 --> 00:15:51.044
YUUKI WAS THE CHEERFUL ONE.

00:15:51.086 --> 00:15:54.923
IN FACT, AIKO WOULD JUST SIT
AND WATCH HER AND SMILE.

00:15:55.924 --> 00:15:57.634
COME TO THINK OF IT,

00:15:57.676 --> 00:16:00.596
IF AIKO WERE HERE, I'D IMAGINE
SHE'D BE A LOT LIKE YOU.

00:16:00.637 --> 00:16:02.764
Asuna: WHERE IS SHE?

00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:05.642
Dr. Kurahashi: YUUKI'S PARENTS
PASSED AWAY TWO YEARS AGO,

00:16:05.684 --> 00:16:09.062
AND LAST YEAR, AIKO.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.319
Asuna: (CRYING) YUUKI.

00:16:16.486 --> 00:16:18.614
YUUKI.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.120
Yuuki: (SIGHS)

00:16:25.162 --> 00:16:27.080
DON'T CRY, ASUNA.

00:16:27.122 --> 00:16:28.790
Asuna: HUH?

00:16:31.168 --> 00:16:32.753
YUUKI.

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:34.713
YUUKI! YOU CAN HEAR ME?!

00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:37.424
Yuuki: YEAH, I CAN HEAR YOU.

00:16:37.466 --> 00:16:39.092
I CAN SEE YOU, TOO.

00:16:39.134 --> 00:16:43.138
WOW, YOU LOOK EXACTLY
LIKE YOU DO IN THE GAME.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.140
THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME.

00:16:45.182 --> 00:16:46.892
Asuna: YUUKI.

00:16:46.934 --> 00:16:49.019
I JUST‐‐I DON'T...

00:16:49.061 --> 00:16:51.104
Yuuki: HEY, DOC,
WOULD IT BE OKAY

00:16:51.146 --> 00:16:52.981
IF ASUNA USED
THE ROOM NEXT‐DOOR?

00:16:53.023 --> 00:16:53.982
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:16:54.024 --> 00:16:55.400
Dr. Kurahashi: SURE. WHY NOT?

00:16:55.442 --> 00:16:58.403
I KEEP AN AMUSPHERE IN THERE
SO I CAN VISIT HER.

00:16:58.445 --> 00:16:59.780
GO AHEAD. IT'S ALL YOURS.

00:16:59.821 --> 00:17:01.740
Asuna: THANKS.

00:17:01.782 --> 00:17:03.784
Yuuki: THE A.L.O. APP'S
ON THE START‐UP MENU.

00:17:03.825 --> 00:17:05.994
AFTER YOU LOG IN,

00:17:06.036 --> 00:17:08.997
COME TO THE PLACE
WHERE WE FIRST MET, OKAY?

00:17:11.124 --> 00:17:13.752
(CHORUS SINGING)

00:17:19.633 --> 00:17:21.552
Asuna: I WANT TO SEE YOU.

00:17:21.593 --> 00:17:24.012
I WANT TO SEE YOU ONE MORE TIME!

00:17:25.514 --> 00:17:27.766
I WANT TO SEE YOU,
AND THIS TIME,

00:17:27.808 --> 00:17:30.185
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU FOR REAL.

00:17:44.408 --> 00:17:45.659
YUUKI!

00:17:50.038 --> 00:17:51.373
YUUKI!

00:17:59.298 --> 00:18:00.465
(GASPS)

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.180
YUUKI.

00:18:07.222 --> 00:18:08.307
(LAUGHS)

00:18:08.348 --> 00:18:09.808
Yuuki: I KNEW IT.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.645
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT,
BUT I HAD A FEELING

00:18:13.687 --> 00:18:16.148
YOU'D FIND ME
IN THE REAL WORLD SOMEHOW.

00:18:16.189 --> 00:18:19.151
AND I WAS SO CAREFUL
NOT TO SAY NOTHIN',

00:18:19.192 --> 00:18:20.819
THOUGHT I HAD YOU FOOLED.

00:18:20.861 --> 00:18:22.362
IT DIDN'T WORK.

00:18:22.404 --> 00:18:23.697
YOU FOUND ME ANYWAY.

00:18:23.739 --> 00:18:25.699
I MUST BE TURNING PSYCHIC,

00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:28.076
'CAUSE MY PREDICTIONS
NEVER COME TRUE.

00:18:28.118 --> 00:18:30.621
BUT I'M HAPPY, REALLY.

00:18:37.336 --> 00:18:39.004
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:18:39.046 --> 00:18:41.256
(SHUDDERS)

00:18:48.842 --> 00:18:50.425
Yuuki: MY SIS USED
TO HUG ME LIKE THIS.

00:18:51.467 --> 00:18:54.845
YOU SMELL LIKE HER,
LIKE THE SUN.

00:18:54.887 --> 00:18:58.557
Asuna: DID AIKO PLAY
V.R.M.M.O.s WITH YOU, TOO?

00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:00.518
Yuuki: YUP. IN FACT,

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:03.854
SHE WAS THE FIRST LEADER
THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS EVER HAD.

00:19:03.896 --> 00:19:08.234
AND IF YOU THOUGHT I WAS STRONG,
MAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER.

00:19:09.235 --> 00:19:11.529
WE MET SIUNE AND THE OTHER GUYS

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.198
IN THIS VIRTUAL HOSPICE
CALLED THE SERENE GARDEN.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.659
BACK THEN,
THERE WERE NINE OF US,

00:19:16.701 --> 00:19:19.286
BUT MY SIS
AND CLOVIS AND MERIDA,

00:19:19.328 --> 00:19:21.956
WELL, THEY'RE ALL GONE.

00:19:21.997 --> 00:19:23.082
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:19:24.458 --> 00:19:26.711
Yuuki: ANYWAY,
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

00:19:26.752 --> 00:19:29.672
WHY WE'RE DISBANDING, IT'S CAUSE
WE PROMISED EACH OTHER

00:19:29.714 --> 00:19:32.299
IF WE LOST SOMEONE,
WE'D END IT.

00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:34.009
I'M SORRY, ASUNA.

00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:36.011
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

00:19:36.053 --> 00:19:39.348
THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS WON'T BE
AROUND ANYMORE BY THIS SPRING,

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.852
BUT IT'S NOT 'CAUSE WE'LL ALL BE
TOO BUSY TO PLAY ANYMORE.

00:19:42.893 --> 00:19:44.603
IT'S 'CAUSE A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

00:19:44.645 --> 00:19:47.273
TWO OF US GOT THE NEWS
FROM OUR DOCTORS.

00:19:47.314 --> 00:19:48.774
THEY GAVE US THREE MONTHS.

00:19:48.816 --> 00:19:49.942
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:19:49.984 --> 00:19:53.154
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

00:19:53.195 --> 00:19:56.657
Yuuki: YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY
WE WERE ALL SO FIRED UP

00:19:56.699 --> 00:19:59.785
ON HAVING ONE LAST BIG ADVENTURE
TOGETHER IN THIS WORLD.

00:19:59.827 --> 00:20:03.122
WE WANTED TO LEAVE SOME KIND
OF PROOF WE WERE HERE

00:20:03.164 --> 00:20:05.875
ON THAT BIG OLD MONUMENT
WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE IT,

00:20:05.916 --> 00:20:08.043
ONE LAST RUN THAT WAS SO COOL,

00:20:08.085 --> 00:20:11.464
WE COULD BRAG ABOUT IT
TO MY SIS AND THE OTHERS.

00:20:11.505 --> 00:20:15.176
BUT NOTHING
WAS GOING RIGHT FOR US,

00:20:15.217 --> 00:20:17.636
SO WE DECIDED
THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE

00:20:17.678 --> 00:20:20.055
WAS TO GET SOMEONE
TOUGH ENOUGH TO HELP.

00:20:20.097 --> 00:20:22.057
BUT WE JUST CAUSED YOU TROUBLE,

00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:24.185
AND WE HURT YOUR FEELINGS, TOO.

00:20:24.226 --> 00:20:25.770
I'M SORRY.

00:20:25.811 --> 00:20:27.104
WE ALL ARE.

00:20:27.146 --> 00:20:28.814
FORGET ABOUT US.

00:20:28.856 --> 00:20:30.900
IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST, ANYWAY.

00:20:32.193 --> 00:20:33.819
Asuna: I CAN'T DO THAT.

00:20:33.861 --> 00:20:37.448
I'M HAPPY I GOT TO MEET YOU,

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.991
ALL OF YOU,

00:20:39.033 --> 00:20:42.411
AND I'M GLAD I GOT TO BE
A PART OF YOUR LAST QUEST.

00:20:42.453 --> 00:20:43.621
EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING,

00:20:43.662 --> 00:20:46.290
I STILL WISH
I COULD JOIN THE KNIGHTS.

00:20:46.332 --> 00:20:49.502
Yuuki: YEAH, I WISH‐‐
I WISH YOU COULD, TOO,

00:20:49.543 --> 00:20:53.172
BUT I'M HAPPY I CAME HERE
AND GOT TO MEET YOU.

00:20:53.214 --> 00:20:55.716
YOU SAYING THAT
MAKES IT WORTH IT,

00:20:55.758 --> 00:20:57.051
MORE THAN WORTH IT.

00:20:57.092 --> 00:20:59.094
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

00:20:59.136 --> 00:21:01.680
I'M GOOD.

00:21:01.722 --> 00:21:05.100
Asuna: BUT ISN'T THERE
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO DO?

00:21:05.142 --> 00:21:06.769
I MEAN, I'M SURE THERE'S

00:21:06.811 --> 00:21:10.022
LOTS OF PLACES IN ALFHEIM
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN YET

00:21:10.064 --> 00:21:11.607
AND OTHER VIRTUAL WORLDS.

00:21:11.649 --> 00:21:14.944
THERE'S STILL LOTS OF THINGS
TO DO AND PLACES TO SEE.

00:21:14.985 --> 00:21:17.112
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

00:21:18.113 --> 00:21:19.949
Yuuki: FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS,

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.369
WE GOT TO GO ON TONS
OF ADVENTURES IN OTHER WORLDS.

00:21:24.411 --> 00:21:26.288
BUT I WANT MY VERY LAST MEMORY

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:29.333
TO BE THE ONE I GOT TO GO ON
WITH YOU, ASUNA.

00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:31.710
Asuna: YEAH, BUT CAN'T YOU
THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE

00:21:31.752 --> 00:21:33.587
YOU WANT TO SEE OR MAYBE DO?

00:21:38.384 --> 00:21:40.177
Yuuki: I DON'T KNOW.

00:21:40.219 --> 00:21:42.513
I GUESS MAYBE
GO TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:44.056
Asuna: UH, FOR REAL?

00:21:44.098 --> 00:21:47.309
Yuuki: NAH, FORGET IT.
JUST KIDDING.

00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:50.145
I'M HAPPY YOU WANT TO HELP,
BUT DON'T SWEAT IT.

00:21:50.187 --> 00:21:53.607
IT'S COOL.
I HAD AN AWESOME LIFE, REALLY.

00:21:59.488 --> 00:22:00.781
Asuna: MAYBE YOU CAN.

00:22:00.823 --> 00:22:02.408
Yuuki: WAIT. WHAT?

00:22:02.449 --> 00:22:05.661
Asuna: MAYBE YOU CAN GO,
YOU KNOW, TO SCHOOL!
