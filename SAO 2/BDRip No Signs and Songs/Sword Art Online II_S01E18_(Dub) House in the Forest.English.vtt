BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME,
WE COULD ONLY PREORDER ONE.

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:19.850
HEH. I REMEMBER
WE PLAYED SOME GAME

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:22.186

TO TRY IT FIRST.

00:04:22.227 --> 00:04:25.063
I'M GLAD IT WAS ME WHO CRACKED
THE SEAL ON IT, NOT HER.

00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:27.566
STILL FEEL THAT WAY.

00:04:27.608 --> 00:04:30.027

WAS THE ONLY TICKET OUT.

00:04:30.068 --> 00:04:32.154

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:47.878

EVERY PLAYER IN AINCRAD

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.506
FELT THE SAME WAY
ABOUT GOING HOME AGAIN.

00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:52.132
RIGHT, ASUNA?

00:04:52.174 --> 00:04:53.926
AIN'T THAT WHAT MOTIVATED YOU?

00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:59.014
I‐I MEAN, IT'S COMPLICATED
BETWEEN ME AND MY FAMILY.

00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:02.476
I GUESS THAT'S WHY THERE ARE
A COUPLE TIMES IN THERE

00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:05.020
I ALMOST FORGOT
WHAT I WAS FIGHTING FOR.

00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:08.065
SOMETIMES I FELT LIKE
I DIDN'T BELONG ANYWHERE.

00:05:08.106 --> 00:05:11.026
REAL AND VIRTUAL
WERE BOTH DEAD ENDS.

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.029
BUT THEN I MET KIRITO.

00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:17.032
HE GAVE ME SOMETHING
I COULD COME HOME TO,

00:05:17.074 --> 00:05:19.660
A PLACE THAT FELT
MORE LIKE A HOME

00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:23.038
THAN ANYTHING I EVER HAD
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.165

EVEN THOUGH I KNEW
ONCE S.A.O. WAS CLEARED,

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:28.877
OUR CABIN WOULD BE GONE.

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.213

THAT ONE DAY,

SOMEHOW I'D HAVE A HOME AGAIN
WITH KIRITO AND YUI.

THAT'S WHAT FINALLY GAVE ME

00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:38.136
THE STRENGTH TO FIGHT
AND KEEP FIGHTING.

00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:40.556

00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:32.951
IT'S LIKE HE'S DARING US
TO STAY AWAKE.

00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:35.245
Asuna: (LAUGHS)
I'LL MAKE SOME MORE TEA,

00:11:35.287 --> 00:11:37.164
AND IT'LL WAKE US RIGHT UP.

00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:40.042
Silica: HEY, LOOK.

00:11:40.083 --> 00:11:42.169
I GUESS IT STOPPED SNOWING
WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING.

00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:43.754
Leafa: YEAH.
IT REALLY CAME DOWN.

00:11:43.795 --> 00:11:45.547
Lisbeth: OH,
HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS?

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:46.548
Asuna: WHAT?

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.133
Lisbeth: YOU KNOW, ABOUT ZEKKEN?

00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:50.052
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.

00:11:50.093 --> 00:11:52.221
Asuna: ZEK‐KEN?

00:11:54.475 --> 00:11:56.644
Asuna: ZEKKEN? IS THAT SOME KIND

00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:58.312
OF RARE ITEM OR SOMETHING?

00:11:58.354 --> 00:11:59.313
Lisbeth: ERRH! WRONG.

00:11:59.355 --> 00:12:01.232
IT'S THE NAME OF A PLAYER.

00:12:01.273 --> 00:12:02.858
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT THEIR HANDLE.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.610
IT'S MORE LIKE A NICKNAME.

00:12:04.652 --> 00:12:07.529
ANYWAY, THIS PLAYER'S SO BADASS,
SOMEONE CALLED THEM ZEKKEN.

00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:10.115
THE NAME CAUGHT ON,
AND THERE YOU GO.

00:12:10.157 --> 00:12:12.076
IT MEANS "ABSOLUTE SWORD."

00:12:12.117 --> 00:12:13.869
ULTIMATE SWORD'S BETTER, THOUGH.

00:12:13.911 --> 00:12:15.871
EITHER WAY, THIS PLAYER'S TOUGH.

00:12:15.913 --> 00:12:17.873
Asuna: REALLY?

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:23.837
SO, UH, WHEN DID YOU FIRST HEAR
ABOUT THIS ZEKKEN PERSON?

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:26.674
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS MAYBE THE FIRST TIME

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:28.634
WAS AROUND NEW YEAR'S
OR SOMETHING,

00:12:28.676 --> 00:12:30.636
MAYBE A WEEK OR SO AGO.

00:12:30.678 --> 00:12:31.971
OH, DUH. THAT EXPLAINS

00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:34.556
WHY YOU'RE
SO OUT OF THE LOOP ABOUT IT.

00:12:34.598 --> 00:12:36.016
YOU'VE BEEN
AT YOUR FAMILY'S COMPOUND

00:12:36.058 --> 00:12:37.309
IN KYOTO THIS WHOLE TIME.

00:12:37.351 --> 00:12:39.478
Asuna: (GROANS)
I WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.563
BUT YOU HAD TO BRING THAT UP.

00:12:41.605 --> 00:12:44.525
Lisbeth: LISTEN TO THE RICH GIRL
REBELING AGAINST HER CUSHY LIFE.

00:12:44.566 --> 00:12:45.734
SOUNDS LIKE A DRAG.

00:12:45.776 --> 00:12:47.611
Asuna: A DRAG
IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.

00:12:47.653 --> 00:12:49.280
I HAD TO SIT ON MY KNEES

00:12:49.321 --> 00:12:51.073
IN A KIMONO ALL DAY
GREETING PEOPLE.

00:12:51.115 --> 00:12:52.992
I BROUGHT MY AMUSPHERE ALONG,

00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:56.829
THINKING I COULD DIVE AT NIGHT
WHILE EVERYONE WAS ASLEEP,

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.247
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:12:58.289 --> 00:13:00.916
THE GUESTHOUSE I WAS IN
DIDN'T HAVE WI‐FI.

00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.334
FUN, RIGHT?

00:13:02.376 --> 00:13:04.295
IT WASN'T.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.342
‐ (MUSIC PLAYING)
‐ (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE )

00:13:33.282 --> 00:13:34.783
Lisbeth: ASUNA.

00:13:36.452 --> 00:13:38.203
ASUNA.

00:13:38.245 --> 00:13:40.664
YOU EVEN LISTENING? HELLO.

00:13:40.706 --> 00:13:42.374
Asuna: HUH? S‐SORRY.

00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:44.001
I JUST REMEMBERED
SOMETHING LAME.

00:13:44.043 --> 00:13:46.170
Lisbeth: I WONDER
WHAT THAT COULD BE.

00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:48.630
WERE YOUR FOLKS TRYING
TO HOOK YOU UP WITH SOMEONE?

00:13:48.672 --> 00:13:51.175
Asuna: N‐NO, NOT AT ALL!
FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

00:13:51.216 --> 00:13:52.176
Lisbeth: (LAUGHS)

00:13:52.217 --> 00:13:53.761
OKAY, OKAY. JUST KIDDING.

00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:56.430
Asuna: SO, ANYWAY,
IS THIS TOUGH NEW PLAYER

00:13:56.472 --> 00:13:57.848
A PK‐er OR SOMETHING?

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.059
Lisbeth: MM‐MM.
JUST A DUELIST. THAT'S ALL.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.810
Asuna: WERE THEY
IN ANY TOURNAMENTS?

00:14:01.852 --> 00:14:03.771
Lisbeth: NOPE.
AS FAR AS I KNOW,

00:14:03.812 --> 00:14:06.065
THIS PLAYER'S A TOTAL NOOB.
I HAVE A FEELING

00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:08.984
THEY MIGHT HAVE CONVERTED OVER
FROM ANOTHER GAME, THOUGH.

00:14:09.026 --> 00:14:10.903
YOU SHOULD SEE
THEIR SKILL STATS.

00:14:10.944 --> 00:14:11.987
THEY'RE THROUGH THE ROOF.

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:14.156
YOU KNOW HOW, ON FLOOR 24,

00:14:14.198 --> 00:14:17.576
THERE'S THAT TINY, LITTLE ISLAND
JUST NORTH OF THE MAIN TOWN,

00:14:17.618 --> 00:14:19.328
THE ONE WITH THE HUGE TREE?

00:14:19.369 --> 00:14:21.205
WELL, EVERY DAY AT 3:00,

00:14:21.246 --> 00:14:23.874
YOU KNOW WHO SHOWS UP
UNDER THAT TREE

00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:26.877
WAITING TO TAKE ON
ANY CHALLENGER ONE‐ON‐ONE.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.300
ZEKKEN STARTED BY POSTING
THIS OPPONENTS WANTED NOTICE

00:14:33.342 --> 00:14:35.803
ON THE MMO TOMORROW
BULLETIN BOARD.

00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:38.931
FOLKS WANTED TO TEACH THIS
COCKY A.L.O. NOOB A LESSON,

00:14:38.972 --> 00:14:41.975
SO ON THE FIRST DAY,
ABOUT 30 PLAYERS SHOWED UP.

00:14:42.017 --> 00:14:44.394
IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL
FOR 'EM, THOUGH.

00:14:44.436 --> 00:14:46.271
Asuna: WHAT? THEY LOST?

00:14:46.313 --> 00:14:48.774
Lisbeth: ALL OF 'EM,
ONE AFTER THE OTHER.

00:14:48.816 --> 00:14:50.818
AND GET THIS.
NONE OF 'EM MANAGED

00:14:50.859 --> 00:14:53.695
TO CHIP OFF MORE THAN 30%
OF ZEKKEN'S H. P.

00:14:53.737 --> 00:14:55.280
THAT'S A BADASS.

00:14:55.322 --> 00:14:58.367
Silica: I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW GOOD ZEKKEN IS.

00:14:58.408 --> 00:15:02.329
WHO THOUGHT A NEWBIE TO THE GAME
COULD FLY AS GOOD AS THAT?

00:15:02.371 --> 00:15:03.789
IT TOOK ME AT LEAST SIX MONTHS

00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:06.041
TO LEARN HOW TO FLY
AND FIGHT AT THE SAME TIME,

00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:08.418
AND I'M STILL LEARNING STUFF.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.504
I‐‐I DID IT.

00:15:10.546 --> 00:15:11.880
WHAAH!

00:15:11.922 --> 00:15:14.133
Asuna: DID YOU
FIGHT ZEKKEN, TOO?

00:15:14.174 --> 00:15:17.094
Silica: NOT EVEN. I'M NO DUMMY.

00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:20.013
I WATCHED ONE DUEL, AND I KNEW
I DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

00:15:20.055 --> 00:15:22.182
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE,

00:15:22.224 --> 00:15:23.892
WHY DON'T YOU ASK LIZ AND LEAFA?

00:15:23.934 --> 00:15:25.227
THEY TOOK ZEKKEN ON YESTERDAY.

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:27.771
THEY FOUGHT AND LOST
LIKE A COUPLE OF CHAMPS.

00:15:27.813 --> 00:15:29.022
Lisbeth: PLEASE DON'T REMIND ME.

00:15:29.064 --> 00:15:30.774
Leafa: GOOD LEARNING EXPERIENCE,
THOUGH.

00:15:30.816 --> 00:15:32.609
Asuna: (LAUGHS)

00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:34.528
AH. IT'S SNOWING.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.614
Silica: YEAH. PRETTY, ISN'T IT?

00:15:39.825 --> 00:15:41.785
Asuna: SO, ANYWAY,
BACK TO ZEKKEN.

00:15:41.827 --> 00:15:44.454
IF THIS PLAYER'S
AS STRONG AS YOU SAY,

00:15:44.496 --> 00:15:46.165
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

00:15:46.206 --> 00:15:48.250
BEFORE THERE ARE
NO MORE CHALLENGERS TO FACE.

00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:50.002
Silica: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:15:50.043 --> 00:15:52.421
THERE'S A PRETTY COOL PRIZE
ON THE LINE, DON'T YOU KNOW?

00:15:52.462 --> 00:15:54.256
Asuna: REALLY? WHAT IS IT,

00:15:54.298 --> 00:15:56.592
SOME KIND OF RARE ITEM
OR SOMETHING?

00:15:56.633 --> 00:15:58.468
Silica: NOPE.
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.388
WHOEVER BEATS ZEKKEN WILL GET
AN ORIGINAL SWORD SKILL.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.184
IT'S A SPECIAL MOVE THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE SUPER STRONG.

00:16:05.225 --> 00:16:07.561
Asuna: AN ORIGINAL SWORD SKILL?

00:16:07.603 --> 00:16:08.854
HUH.

00:16:08.896 --> 00:16:11.023
WHAT TYPE? HOW MANY HITS?

00:16:11.064 --> 00:16:13.108
Silica: MM...

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.278
WELL, IT'S A GENERAL SKILL
FOR A ONE‐HANDED SWORD.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.946
OH, BUT HERE'S THE THING.

00:16:17.988 --> 00:16:19.198
IT'S AN 11‐HIT COMBO!

00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:21.158
Asuna: NO WAY! 11?!

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.202
Lisbeth: THE STRONGEST
ORIGINAL SWORD SKILL

00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:26.121
BEING USED RIGHT NOW,
HOW MANY HITS DOES IT HAVE?

00:16:26.163 --> 00:16:28.624
Leafa: THAT'D BE THE ONE
GENERAL EUGENE DEVELOPED,

00:16:28.665 --> 00:16:29.958
THE VOLCANIC BLAZER.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.044
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
AN EIGHT‐HIT COMBO.

00:16:32.085 --> 00:16:34.713
HE HASN'T PASSED IT ON
TO ANYONE ELSE YET,

00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:36.506
AND I DOUBT HE EVER WILL.

00:16:36.548 --> 00:16:39.009
Asuna: I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS
WHY SO MANY PLAYERS

00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:40.677
KEEP LINING UP
TO CHALLENGE ZEKKEN.

00:16:40.719 --> 00:16:43.305
HAVE ANY OF YOU SEEN
THIS SWORD SKILL IN ACTION?

00:16:43.347 --> 00:16:45.974
Lisbeth: MM‐MM.
I HEARD ZEKKEN DEMOED IT

00:16:46.016 --> 00:16:48.310
ON THE FIRST DAY
OF THE DUELS, THOUGH.

00:16:48.352 --> 00:16:51.521
APPARENTLY IT BLEW MINDS
LEFT AND RIGHT,

00:16:51.563 --> 00:16:55.025
BUT SINCE THEN, IT HASN'T
BEEN USED IN ANY OF THE FIGHTS.

00:16:55.067 --> 00:16:57.986
MAYBE THE REASON FOR THAT'S
'CAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN

00:16:58.028 --> 00:17:00.948
ANYONE TOUGH ENOUGH
TO GET ZEKKEN TO USE IT.

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:03.075
WHOEVER DOES HAS MY RESPECT.

00:17:04.076 --> 00:17:05.535
Asuna: LEAFA,

00:17:05.577 --> 00:17:07.579
WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU FOUGHT ZEKKEN?

00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:11.041
Leafa: BESIDES LOSING?
IT WAS GOING GOOD

00:17:11.083 --> 00:17:14.044
TILL OUR H.P.s
DROPPED BELOW 60%, BUT...

00:17:16.088 --> 00:17:18.757
IN THE END, ZEKKEN BEAT ME

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:21.009
USING NOTHING
BUT DEFAULT SKILLS.

00:17:21.051 --> 00:17:22.678
Asuna: REALLY?

00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:25.639
OH! I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ALMOST FORGOT TO ASK.

00:17:25.681 --> 00:17:27.975
WHAT'S ZEKKEN'S RACE
AND WEAPON OF CHOICE?

00:17:28.016 --> 00:17:29.268
Leafa: AN IMP.

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:31.436
THE MAIN WEAPON'S
A ONE‐HANDED SWORD.

00:17:31.478 --> 00:17:32.729
IT'S ABOUT AS SKINNY

00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:34.940
AS YOUR RAPIER, ASUNA,
BUT ONLY JUST.

00:17:34.982 --> 00:17:37.234
AND ZEKKEN'S SUPER FAST, TOO.

00:17:37.276 --> 00:17:40.237
I COULDN'T EVEN SEE
THE ATTACKS COMING AT ME.

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:42.239
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED
TO ME BEFORE.

00:17:42.281 --> 00:17:43.907
I'M STILL KIND OF SHOCKED.

00:17:43.949 --> 00:17:45.576
Asuna: A SPEED TYPE, HUH?

00:17:45.617 --> 00:17:48.245
IF YOU HAD A HARD TIME
TRACKING ZEKKEN,

00:17:48.287 --> 00:17:50.372
I DOUBT I'D BE ABLE TO, EITHER.

00:17:50.414 --> 00:17:53.250
AH! I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO MIGHT, THOUGH.

00:17:53.292 --> 00:17:55.961
MR. SLEEPYHEAD'S
THE FASTEST PLAYER I'VE SEEN.

00:17:56.003 --> 00:17:57.629
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

00:17:57.671 --> 00:18:00.173
WOULD KIRITO
GO FOR THAT KIND OF CHALLENGE?

00:18:00.215 --> 00:18:02.175
Lisbeth and Silica: (LAUGH)

00:18:02.217 --> 00:18:04.258
Asuna: WHAT? WHAT'D I SAY?

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.052
Leafa: (LAUGHS) NOTHING.

00:18:06.094 --> 00:18:08.054
IT'S JUST KAZUTO
ALREADY TRIED IT,

00:18:08.096 --> 00:18:10.556
AND, BOY, DID HE
LOSE SPECTACULARLY.

00:18:10.598 --> 00:18:12.475
All: (LAUGH)

00:18:12.517 --> 00:18:14.310
Asuna: I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

00:18:14.352 --> 00:18:15.645
WAS HE HOLDING BACK?

00:18:15.687 --> 00:18:16.771
Lisbeth: HMM.

00:18:16.813 --> 00:18:19.107
KIND OF HARD FOR ME TO SAY.

00:18:19.148 --> 00:18:21.526
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING,
IT LOOKED LIKE IT.

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:24.153
YEAH, BUT THEN I DON'T THINK
I'M REALLY THE BEST PERSON

00:18:24.195 --> 00:18:25.863
TO JUDGE
WHETHER HE WAS OR WASN'T.

00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:28.199
HE DIDN'T USE
THAT DUAL‐WIELDING TRICK.

00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:29.701
THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:33.371
SO I GUESS, IN A WAY,
HE WASN'T GOING ALL OUT.

00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:34.956
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:18:34.997 --> 00:18:37.125
THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE.

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:40.253
I MEAN, IT'S A DUEL
IN A NORMAL GAME.

00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:42.588
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR KIRITO TO FIGHT

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.841
LIKE HIS LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT ANYMORE.

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:47.343
THE ONLY TIME HE'LL TAKE
A FIGHT SERIOUSLY NOW

00:18:47.385 --> 00:18:50.555
IS IF THE GAME
STOPS BEING A GAME,

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:53.307
WHEN THE VIRTUAL WORLD
BECOMES THE REAL WORLD.

00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:56.352
IN A WAY, I HOPE
HE NEVER GOES FULL TILT

00:18:56.394 --> 00:18:57.895
IN A BATTLE EVER AGAIN.

00:18:57.937 --> 00:18:59.772
HE'S KIND OF HAD ENOUGH OF THAT.

00:18:59.814 --> 00:19:02.442
I MEAN, HECK,
HE GETS INTO ENOUGH TROUBLE

00:19:02.483 --> 00:19:04.527
ON HIS OWN AS IT IS.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.571
Asuna: HEH.

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:08.322
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:19:09.532 --> 00:19:11.576
Leafa: WELL,
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING,

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:13.244
I GOT A DIFFERENT IMPRESSION.

00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:16.247
I THINK KAZUTO WAS
DEFINITELY GIVING IT HIS ALL.

00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:18.791
HE SEEMED SERIOUS
AND FOCUSED AND DETERMINED.

00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:20.793
HE PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT.

00:19:20.835 --> 00:19:23.171
AT ONE POINT, THOUGH,
SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENED.

00:19:24.172 --> 00:19:26.215
RIGHT BEFORE THE DUEL WAS OVER,

00:19:26.257 --> 00:19:27.550
THEY WERE LOCKING SWORDS,

00:19:27.592 --> 00:19:31.095
AND THEN THEY BOTH JUST STOPPED.

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:34.557
IT LOOKED LIKE KAZUTO
WAS SAYING SOMETHING TO ZEKKEN.

00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:37.018
I COULDN'T HEAR WHAT
'CAUSE OF ALL THE CHEERING.

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:38.895
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:19:38.936 --> 00:19:40.480
THEY BACKED OFF FROM EACH OTHER.

00:19:40.521 --> 00:19:42.857
ZEKKEN CHARGED HIM.

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:44.901
BUT KAZUTO COULDN'T DODGE IT,

00:19:44.942 --> 00:19:46.319
AND THAT'S HOW THE DUEL ENDED.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.987
Asuna: REALLY?

00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:49.697
WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

00:19:49.739 --> 00:19:51.115
Leafa: I WISH I KNEW.

00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:53.075
I ASKED HIM,
BUT KAZUTO WOULDN'T TELL ME.

00:19:53.117 --> 00:19:54.494
WHATEVER IT WAS,

00:19:54.535 --> 00:19:56.662
IT MUST BE PRETTY IMPORTANT
TO KEEP TO HIMSELF.

00:19:56.704 --> 00:19:58.706
Asuna: INTERESTING.

00:19:58.748 --> 00:19:59.999
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:02.627
I GUESS THE ONLY WAY
TO FIND OUT WHAT HE SAID

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:04.212
IS TO ASK ZEKKEN MYSELF.

00:20:04.253 --> 00:20:07.048
Lisbeth: HUH. YOU THINK
YOU'RE UP TO THE CHALLENGE?

00:20:07.089 --> 00:20:09.759
Asuna: I'M NOT DOING IT
'CAUSE I THINK I CAN WIN.

00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:12.637
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ZEKKEN
PERSON INTRIGUES ME, IS ALL.

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:16.307
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I THINK
THIS ZEKKEN PERSON'S HERE

00:20:16.349 --> 00:20:17.975
FOR REASONS OTHER THAN DUELING.

00:20:18.017 --> 00:20:19.727
Lisbeth: YEP,
THAT'S WHAT I THINK, TOO.

00:20:19.769 --> 00:20:22.480
BUT IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS, GET READY,

00:20:22.522 --> 00:20:24.023
'CAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO PUT UP

00:20:24.065 --> 00:20:26.442
AS GOOD A FIGHT AS YOUR BOY
KIRITO AND THEN SOME.

00:20:26.484 --> 00:20:28.903
Asuna: (LAUGHS)
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:20:28.945 --> 00:20:30.905
WILL YOU GUYS COME CHEER ME ON?

00:20:30.947 --> 00:20:32.865
‐ All: MM‐HMM.
‐ Silica: YOU KNOW WE WILL.

00:20:32.907 --> 00:20:35.368
IT'LL BE AWESOME. WE WOULDN'T
MISS IT FOR ANYTHING.

00:20:35.409 --> 00:20:37.745
Lisbeth: WHICH CHARACTER
ARE YOU GONNA DUEL WITH?

00:20:37.787 --> 00:20:40.248
YOU STILL HAVE
THE SYLPH ACCOUNT, DON'T YA?

00:20:40.289 --> 00:20:42.875
Asuna: HMM.
I GUESS I'LL USE THIS ONE.

00:20:42.917 --> 00:20:45.878
IF ZEKKEN'S A SPEED TYPE,
IT'LL PROBABLY COME DOWN

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.798
TO WHO CAN HOLD OUT THE LONGEST,
RATHER THAN D.P.S.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.383
AND THAT'S THAT.

00:20:50.424 --> 00:20:53.386
SO 3:00 ON THE ISLAND
ON FLOOR 24, RIGHT?

00:20:53.427 --> 00:20:54.929
Leafa: MM‐HMM.

00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:58.224
Asuna: THEN IF WE MEET HERE
TOMORROW AT 2:30, WE CAN‐‐

00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:01.394
OH, NO. IT'S ALREADY 6:00?
I'LL BE LATE FOR DINNER.

00:21:01.435 --> 00:21:05.314
Leafa: I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL
CALL IT A DAY AND LOG OUT, TOO.

00:21:05.356 --> 00:21:07.859
Lisbeth: RICH GIRLS
AND THEIR PROBLEMS. AM I RIGHT?

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.237
Silica: (GIGGLES) I CAN'T
BELIEVE HE'S STILL ASLEEP.

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:13.739
Leafa: I KNOW.
HE DIDN'T EVEN FEEL A THING.

00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:15.741
‐ Asuna: HEY, LIZ.
‐ Lisbeth: WHAT'S UP?

00:21:15.783 --> 00:21:17.493
Asuna: A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

00:21:17.535 --> 00:21:20.037
YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT ZEKKEN
CONVERTED OVER TO A.L.O.

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:23.457
THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED THE DUELS
GOT ME THINKING.

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:26.961
COULD ZEKKEN BE
SOMEONE FROM S.A.O.?

00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:33.467
Lisbeth: UH‐HUH.

00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:36.012
THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GOT
AFTER MY DUEL.

00:21:36.053 --> 00:21:38.097
I WANTED A SECOND OPINION,

00:21:38.139 --> 00:21:41.976
SO AFTER KIRITO LOST HIS,
I ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT.

00:21:42.018 --> 00:21:44.937
Asuna: SO WHAT DID
KIRITO HAVE TO SAY?

00:21:44.979 --> 00:21:47.356
Lisbeth: HE SAID
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE SKILLS

00:21:47.398 --> 00:21:49.567
WERE THROUGH THE ROOF,
ZEKKEN'S DEFINITELY NOT

00:21:49.609 --> 00:21:51.903
A PLAYER FROM S.A.O.
THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:21:51.944 --> 00:21:55.698
KIRITO ALSO SAID THAT IF ZEKKEN
REALLY WAS FROM S.A.O.,

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.326
THE DUAL‐WIELDING SKILL
WOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO HIM.

00:21:58.367 --> 00:22:01.245
IT WOULD HAVE GONE TO ZEKKEN.

00:22:01.287 --> 00:22:02.330
Asuna: (GASPS)
