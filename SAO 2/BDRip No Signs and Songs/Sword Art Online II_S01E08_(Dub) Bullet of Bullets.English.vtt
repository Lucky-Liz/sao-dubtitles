WEBVTT

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:20.910
Death Gun: WHETHER YOU'RE
A FAKE USING HIS NAME

00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:22.620
OR THE REAL GUY,

00:00:22.662 --> 00:00:25.706
SOMEDAY I'LL KILL YOU.

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:37.552
Kirito: THE FIRST TIME
DEATH GUN SHOWED UP

00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:39.887
WAS AFTER THE SECOND
BULLET OF BULLETS,

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.390
AND BOTH
OF THE MURDERS HE COMMITTED

00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:44.851
HAPPENED IN FRONT
OF WITNESSES.

00:00:44.892 --> 00:00:47.270
HE'S BEEN STAYING
UNDER THE RADAR

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:48.646
SINCE THE LAST KILLING,

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:52.316
PROBABLY LEVELING UP
AS MUCH AS HE CAN.

00:00:52.358 --> 00:00:55.236
I DON'T SEE ANYONE REGISTERED
AS DEATH GUN HERE,

00:00:55.278 --> 00:00:57.905
BUT IF HE WANTS
TO STAGE ANOTHER MURDER,

00:00:57.947 --> 00:00:59.657
B.o.B.'s PERFECT.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.284
HE'LL BE HERE.

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:02.785
I KNOW IT.

00:01:02.827 --> 00:01:06.122
I GOTTA FIND OUT THE NAME
OF DEATH GUN'S AVATAR

00:01:06.163 --> 00:01:07.164
AND STOP HIM.

00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:56.066
Kirito: HEY.

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:57.735
HEY, SINON.

00:02:59.695 --> 00:03:01.614
HELLO. ANYONE HOME?

00:03:02.823 --> 00:03:04.158
‐ COME O‐‐
‐ Sinon: SHUT UP.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.577
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR
I WAS DONE TALKING.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.496
GOD, WHAT ELSE
DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

00:03:08.537 --> 00:03:09.497
Kirito: N‐NOTHING.

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:11.290
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:13.959
MAYBE WE COULD SWAP SOME INFO
BEFORE THIS STARTS.

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:15.920
I MEAN...

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:18.881
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:22.301
Sinon: (SIGHS)

00:03:22.343 --> 00:03:23.594
FINE. WHATEVER.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:24.595
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:25.630
Sinon: I'LL DO IT,

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.341
EVEN THOUGH I'M THE ONE WHO'S
GONNA BE GIVING ALL THE INFO.

00:03:28.383 --> 00:03:30.301
Kirito: BUT I GOT STUFF
TO SHARE, TOO.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:31.928
IT'S NOT A LOT, BUT STILL...

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.601
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:44.065
Interviewer:
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:45.692
YOU THINK YOU GOT A SHOT
THIS TIME?

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:48.319
Dyne: BY THE TIME HE SEES ME,
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.654
Kirito: THIS IS CRAZY.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.781
Sinon: YEAH. THE FINAL
IS LIKE ONE BIG PARTY.

00:03:51.823 --> 00:03:53.450
Kirito: YEAH. (CHUCKLES)

00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:55.285
Merchant: ...PICKING A WINNER IS
GONNA BE TOUGHER THAN EVER!

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:57.871
FOR ONLY 1,000 CREDS,
I CAN HOOK YOU UP

00:03:57.912 --> 00:04:00.165
WITH TOP‐SECRET INFO
ON ALL THE TOP PLAYERS.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.125
Player: HERE GOES.
ALL ON YAMIKAZE.

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:04.127
Player 2: I WONDER
WHAT HUUKA'S ODDS ARE.

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.545
Player 3: COME ON. DYNE?

00:04:05.587 --> 00:04:07.797
SURE, HE'S GOT GOOD GEAR
AND SOLID SKILLS,

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.049
BUT THAT DUDE'S
OLDER THAN HELL, YOU KNOW.

00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:11.759
AT BEST,
HE'D COME IN 15th TODAY.

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:14.596
IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH
A LONG SHOT, GO WITH RICHIE.

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:15.597
HMM?

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:17.098
Dyne: (CHUCKLES)

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.350
SO YOU THINK
I'M TOO OLD TO GET IT ON?

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.810
Player 3:
NO, I WAS JUST SAYING...

00:04:20.852 --> 00:04:22.437
Dyne: THIS OLD DOG'S
GOT SOME NEW TRICKS.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.438
Player 4: HEY, LOOK.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.440
I‐IT'S KIRITO.

00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:27.859
Player 5: SHE HACKS UP PEOPLE
GOOD WITH THAT PHOTON SWORD.

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:31.321
Player 6: OH,
A HOT BERSERKER WITH A BLADE.

00:04:31.362 --> 00:04:33.364
Player 5:
SINON'S MORE MY TYPE, BROTHER.

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.533
Player 4: I WOULDN'T MIND
GETTING A BULLET FROM SINON.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:36.826
Player 5: ROGER THAT.

00:04:36.868 --> 00:04:38.328
Player 6: HEH.
I'D RATHER GET SLASHED.

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:40.580
Player 4: THEN GO PLAY A.L.O.
WITH THE FAERIES.

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:42.957
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.083
OH, SORRY.

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:45.835
Players:
(GASPS) YOU'RE KIRITO!

00:04:45.877 --> 00:04:46.878
S‐SORRY!

00:04:50.632 --> 00:04:51.591
(GASPS)

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:52.926
(SHUDDERING)

00:04:52.967 --> 00:04:54.844
Kirito: HEY, GUYS...

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.766
HOPE Y'ALL ROOT FOR ME.

00:04:59.808 --> 00:05:01.976
Players: (GASP)

00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:04.687
Player 7: Y‐YOU GOT IT.
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.440
Player 8:
I BET MY LIFE SAVINGS ON YOU.

00:05:07.482 --> 00:05:08.691
Kirito: (LAUGHS)

00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:10.944
Sinon: OH, GOD.
QUIT MESSING WITH THEM.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.411
Kirito: OKAY. (CLEARS THROAT)

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:25.333
SO 30 PLAYERS GET DROPPED
RANDOMLY ACROSS THE SAME MAP,

00:05:25.374 --> 00:05:26.709
AND THEN‐‐(GASPS)

00:05:26.751 --> 00:05:30.171
AND THEN YOU GO AROUND
SHOOTING WHOEVER YOU FIND,

00:05:30.212 --> 00:05:32.131
AND THE WINNER'S
THE LAST ONE STANDING?

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:35.092
Sinon: OH, MAN. KNEW IT.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.427
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME EXPLAIN

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.637
THE WHOLE DAMN THING
TO YOU AFTER ALL.

00:05:40.264 --> 00:05:41.307
DON'T YOU HAVE E‐MAIL?

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.017
THE ADMINS SENT THE RULES OUT,

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:44.977
SO IT SHOULD BE SITTING
IN YOUR IN‐BOX.

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.063
Kirito: YEAH, I DID
SCAN THROUGH IT, BUT...

00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:50.524
IT'S LIKE I WANTED
TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:53.194
THERE WAS A LOT OF INFO
TO ABSORB.

00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:54.445
Sinon: (SCOFFS) "ABSORB."

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:59.116
BASICALLY YOU PRETTY MUCH
GOT THE GIST OF IT.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:00.910
THIS THING'S A BATTLE ROYALE

00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.245
BETWEEN 30 PLAYERS
ON THE SAME MAP.

00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:05.915
START POINTS ARE RANDOM,
AND PLAYERS ARE DROPPED

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:08.250
ABOUT 1,000 METERS
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

00:06:08.292 --> 00:06:09.502
Kirito: WHOA. 1,000.

00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:12.588
THAT'S GOTTA BE
ONE INSANELY HUGE MAP.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.591
Sinon: HONESTLY, YOU DIDN'T
READ THE E‐MAIL, DID YOU?

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:17.218
(SIGHS)

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.888
IT'S A MULTISTAGE ARENA
10 KILOMETERS IN DIAMETER.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.265
IT'S GOT MOUNTAINS,
FORESTS, AND DESERTS.

00:06:23.307 --> 00:06:25.267
THE START TIME'S AFTERNOON,

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:27.269
SO THERE'S NO ADVANTAGE
OR DISADVANTAGE

00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:29.647
IN TERMS OF GEAR OR SKILLS.

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:32.316
Kirito: HOW CAN YOU FIND ANYONE
IN A FIELD THAT BIG?

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:33.818
Sinon:
THAT MAKES IT CHALLENGING.

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:35.903
IT'S A GAME WITH GUNFIGHTS,
REMEMBER?

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:39.365
ANYWAY, PLAYERS GET AN ITEM
TO TRACK OTHER PLAYERS.

00:06:39.407 --> 00:06:41.534
IT'S CALLED A SATELLITE
SCAN TERMINAL.

00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:42.785
Kirito: THERE'S A SATELLITE?

00:06:42.827 --> 00:06:44.620
LIKE A SPY DRONE OR SOMETHING?

00:06:44.662 --> 00:06:45.621
Sinon: YEP.

00:06:45.663 --> 00:06:47.957
IT WORKS JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE.

00:06:47.998 --> 00:06:50.543
IT PASSES OVERHEAD
EVERY 15 MINUTES.

00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:51.794
IT SCANS THE ARENA

00:06:51.836 --> 00:06:53.254
AND THEN TRANSMITS
THE COORDINATES

00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:55.923
OF ALL THE PLAYERS
DIRECTLY TO YOUR TERMINAL.

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:57.091
NEAT, HUH?

00:06:57.133 --> 00:06:58.717
Kirito: HMM.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.139
SO BASICALLY YOU CAN ONLY HIDE
IN ONE SPOT FOR 15 MINUTES.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.932
Sinon: YOU CATCH ON QUICK.

00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:07.434
Kirito: BUT THEN DOESN'T
ALL THAT MOVING AROUND

00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:09.228
PUT A SNIPER
AT A DISADVANTAGE?

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:11.272
Sinon: 15 MINUTES
IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME

00:07:11.313 --> 00:07:13.190
FOR A SNIPER TO DO THEIR JOB.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.192
I FIRE. I KILL MY TARGET.

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:16.694
I MOVE ON.

00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:19.947
Kirito: UH, YEAH, I GUESS.

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:22.116
Sinon: SO WE GOOD HERE? GREAT.

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:23.617
NEXT TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER...

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:24.994
‐ Kirito: NO! WAIT!
‐ Sinon: YOU CAN BET YOUR ASS‐‐

00:07:25.035 --> 00:07:26.620
‐ Kirito: HOLD ON!
‐ (DRINK SPILLS)

00:07:30.957 --> 00:07:31.958
Sinon: IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.293
Kirito: UH‐HUH.

00:07:33.335 --> 00:07:35.837
IT'S WHAT I REALLY
WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:40.509
Sinon: (SIGHS)

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:43.929
MM.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.305
Kirito: HANG ON.

00:07:45.347 --> 00:07:48.183
COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS LIST REAL QUICK?

00:07:48.225 --> 00:07:50.185
OUT OF ALL
THE B.o.B. CONTESTANTS,

00:07:50.227 --> 00:07:53.188
ARE THERE ANY FIRST‐TIMERS
WHOSE NAMES YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE?

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.731
Sinon: OKAY, THAT'S WEIRD.

00:07:54.773 --> 00:07:57.734
Kirito: PLEASE,
JUST LOOK AT IT, AND TELL ME.

00:07:57.776 --> 00:07:58.819
IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.281
Sinon: WELL, IF THAT'S
ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW,

00:08:03.323 --> 00:08:04.700
I GUESS IT'S COOL.

00:08:06.034 --> 00:08:08.662
THE FIRST‐TIMERS I DON'T KNOW,

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:11.456
BESIDES A CERTAIN LOSER
WITH A PHOTON SWORD,

00:08:11.498 --> 00:08:12.624
ARE THREE NAMES.

00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:14.334
Kirito: THAT'S GREAT. WHO?

00:08:14.376 --> 00:08:16.044
POINT 'EM OUT.

00:08:18.004 --> 00:08:20.340
Sinon: JUSHI X, PALE RIDER,

00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:23.176
AND THIS GUY,

00:08:23.218 --> 00:08:25.011
STERBEN?

00:08:26.346 --> 00:08:29.266
Kirito: (THINKING)
IS ONE OF THEM DEATH GUN?

00:08:29.307 --> 00:08:31.268
Sinon: YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,

00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:33.228
OR ARE YOU
GONNA KEEP ME IN THE DARK?

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.563
Kirito: UH...

00:08:39.818 --> 00:08:42.154
Sinon: GETTING READY
TO BLOW A FUSE OVER HERE.

00:08:42.195 --> 00:08:42.947
Kirito: UH...

00:08:43.506 --> 00:08:44.508
Sinon: SPEAK UP.

00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:46.825
I SWEAR, IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE ME MESS UP TODAY

00:08:46.867 --> 00:08:48.118
BY PISSING ME OFF, I'M GONNA...

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.163
Kirito: NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:52.581
IT'S JUST THAT...

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:56.085
Sinon: DOES IT
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

00:08:56.126 --> 00:08:58.254
WITH WHY YOU WERE
ACTING WEIRD YESTERDAY,

00:08:58.295 --> 00:08:59.838
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE PRELIMS?

00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:08.096
Kirito: UH‐HUH. IT DOES.

00:09:08.138 --> 00:09:12.225
YESTERDAY, THIS PERSON
I ONCE PLAYED AGAINST

00:09:12.267 --> 00:09:14.811
IN ANOTHER V.R.M.M.O.
CAME UP TO ME.

00:09:14.853 --> 00:09:19.441
I'M PRETTY SURE ONE OF THE NAMES
YOU POINTED OUT IS HIM.

00:09:19.483 --> 00:09:21.568
Sinon: IS HE A FRIEND OF YOURS?

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.237
Kirito: NO, AN ENEMY.

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:27.491
I CAN'T REMEMBER
HIS NAME, THOUGH,

00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:31.578
AND I THINK WE TRIED
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

00:09:32.788 --> 00:09:34.539
Sinon: KILL EACH OTHER?

00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:36.083
FOR REAL?

00:09:36.124 --> 00:09:39.336
WAS IT LIKE AN ARGUMENT
WITH SOMEONE IN YOUR PARTY,

00:09:39.377 --> 00:09:40.504
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:42.506
Kirito: NO WAY.
IT WASN'T THAT.

00:09:42.547 --> 00:09:44.758
YOU DON'T KILL SOMEONE
OVER AN ARGUMENT.

00:09:45.967 --> 00:09:48.095
HIM AND HIS GROUP
DID HORRIBLE THINGS,

00:09:48.136 --> 00:09:51.431
THINGS LIKE MURDER.

00:09:51.473 --> 00:09:53.350
THEY WERE TOO FAR GONE,

00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:56.061
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP THEM WAS BY FORCE.

00:09:56.103 --> 00:09:59.231
I DON'T REGRET WHAT I DID,

00:09:59.272 --> 00:10:04.027
BUT STILL, I'VE AVOIDED
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:07.572
I FORCED MYSELF TO FORGET
IT EVEN HAPPENED.

00:10:10.992 --> 00:10:13.453
FOR ME,
THERE'S NO MORE RUNNING AWAY,

00:10:13.495 --> 00:10:17.165
AND THIS TIME, I HAVE TO FACE
WHAT I DID HEAD‐ON.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.377
SORRY TO EMOTE LIKE THAT.

00:10:20.418 --> 00:10:22.087
JUST FORGET IT.

00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:25.340
Sinon: DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
STILL PULL THE TRIGGER, THOUGH?

00:10:25.382 --> 00:10:26.800
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:10:26.842 --> 00:10:29.177
COULD YOU SHOOT A PLAYER IN HERE

00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:33.640
IF YOU KNEW, IN THE REAL WORLD,
THAT PLAYER WOULD DIE FROM IT?

00:10:33.682 --> 00:10:36.351
AND WHAT IF YOU
HAD TO KILL THAT PLAYER,

00:10:36.393 --> 00:10:39.646
'CAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T, YOU OR
SOMEONE YOU LOVE WOULD DIE?

00:10:39.688 --> 00:10:41.648
IF YOU HAD THAT POWER,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.775
COULD YOU STILL
PULL THAT TRIGGER?

00:10:43.817 --> 00:10:45.277
Sinon: KIRITO...

00:10:45.318 --> 00:10:48.947
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME
YOU MET THIS GUY IN?

00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:54.494
SORRY. NEVER MIND.
THAT'S PERSONAL.

00:10:54.536 --> 00:10:56.329
Kirito: NO, THAT'S OKAY.

00:11:01.543 --> 00:11:02.669
Sinon: KIRITO...

00:11:04.004 --> 00:11:05.338
I...

00:11:08.425 --> 00:11:09.676
Kirito: SINON?

00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:14.556
Sinon: WE SHOULD START HEADING
OVER TO THE WAITING DOME NOW.

00:11:14.598 --> 00:11:16.308
WE HAVE TO CHECK OUR GEAR

00:11:16.349 --> 00:11:18.602
AND GET OURSELVES
PSYCHED UP FOR THIS BATTLE.

00:11:18.643 --> 00:11:20.061
Kirito: YEAH, SURE.

00:11:20.103 --> 00:11:21.354
LEAD THE WAY.

00:11:36.912 --> 00:11:40.207
Sinon: I GET YOU'VE GOT
YOUR REASONS FOR BEING HERE,

00:11:40.248 --> 00:11:41.541
JUST LIKE ME.

00:11:42.792 --> 00:11:44.753
BUT IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO

00:11:44.794 --> 00:11:46.463
WITH THAT PROMISE YOU MADE.

00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:48.131
I GOTTA PAY YOU BACK

00:11:48.173 --> 00:11:51.259
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
IN YESTERDAY'S FINAL. GOT IT?

00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:55.222
YOU OWE ME A FIGHT,
SO YOU BETTER STAY ALIVE.

00:11:55.263 --> 00:11:57.557
Kirito: ROGER THAT.
I PROMISE I'LL SURVIVE

00:11:57.599 --> 00:11:59.935
AND GIVE YOU THE FIGHT YOU WANT.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:02.896
Sinon: THANKS.

00:12:08.735 --> 00:12:10.278
Emcee: IF YOU'RE
A BATTLE JUNKIE

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.656

00:12:12.697 --> 00:12:14.199

00:12:14.241 --> 00:12:16.076

Merchant: (CHUCKLES)

00:12:17.744 --> 00:12:20.455
Emcee: NOW ARE
YOU GUYS READY TO FIND OUT

00:12:20.497 --> 00:12:22.916
WHO'S THE STRONGEST PLAYER
IN "GUN GALE ONLINE,"

00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.626
THE HARDEST GAME IN TOWN?

00:12:24.668 --> 00:12:27.337
Crowd: (CHEERING, YELLING)

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.926
Emcee: AS USUAL, MMO STREAM

00:12:32.968 --> 00:12:35.637
WILL BE BROADCASTING THE BATTLE
LIVE AND UNCENSORED!

00:12:37.806 --> 00:12:41.977
ALL RIGHT, HELP ME OUT
WITH THE COUNTDOWN, GUYS.

00:12:45.313 --> 00:12:48.191
Crowd: 10, 9, 8,

00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:51.194

00:12:54.155 --> 00:12:55.156
1!

00:12:56.491 --> 00:12:58.952
Emcee: THE THIRD
BULLET OF BULLETS HAS BEGUN!

00:12:58.994 --> 00:13:02.664
Crowd: (CHEERING)

00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:20.725
Crowd: (CHEERING)

00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:25.188
(GUNFIRE)

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:47.418
Player 9: (GASPS)

00:13:54.342 --> 00:13:55.343
Dyne: (CHUCKLES)

00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:06.980
Sinon: (SCOFFS)

00:14:07.021 --> 00:14:08.398
HMM?

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.570
BINGO.

00:14:18.616 --> 00:14:21.494
Crowd: (CHEERING)

00:14:21.536 --> 00:14:23.454
‐ Player 4: ALL RIGHT.
‐ Player 5: YEAH, YOU GO, GIRL.

00:14:36.968 --> 00:14:40.013
Sinon: 21 SURVIVORS
LEFT IN PLAY.

00:14:48.813 --> 00:14:50.815
LOOKS LIKE DYNE'S ON THE RUN.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.360
RICHIE'S GOT
A HEAVY MACHINE GUN,

00:14:54.402 --> 00:14:55.778
SO HE'LL SIT TIGHT.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.448
HE LIKES HIS PREY COMING TO HIM.

00:14:58.489 --> 00:15:01.284
I'LL GO AFTER DYNE
AND PALE RIDER.

00:15:03.328 --> 00:15:06.039
WONDER HOW HE'S DOING OUT THERE.

00:15:09.917 --> 00:15:12.253
AH, WHAT THE HELL DO I CARE?

00:15:31.606 --> 00:15:33.024
Dyne: (PANTING)

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:37.445
DAMN. THIS GUY'S
FREAKING PERSISTENT.

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:39.906
EH?

00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:47.372
HEH.

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:02.804
COME ON. I GOT A MAG FULL
OF ROUNDS WITH YOUR NAME ON 'EM.

00:16:07.308 --> 00:16:10.436
Sinon: YOU FORGOT
TO CHECK YOUR SIX AGAIN, DYNE.

00:16:10.478 --> 00:16:11.562
SEE YOU LATER.

00:16:12.855 --> 00:16:14.399
(GASPS)

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.483
WHO'S THERE?

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:19.404
Kirito: SHH.

00:16:20.405 --> 00:16:21.364
KEEP IT DOWN.

00:16:21.406 --> 00:16:22.615
I NEED A FAVOR.

00:16:22.657 --> 00:16:23.825
Sinon: ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:16:23.866 --> 00:16:25.493
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR ANY MORE FAVORS.

00:16:25.535 --> 00:16:28.413
ONE OF US DIES RIGHT NOW.

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:29.914
Kirito: STOP IT.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:31.874
I DON'T WANT THOSE GUYS
TO KNOW WE'RE HERE.

00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:33.376
Sinon: WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

00:16:33.418 --> 00:16:36.170
Kirito: I WANT TO WATCH
WHAT HAPPENS ON THAT BRIDGE,

00:16:36.212 --> 00:16:38.381
SO DON'T SHOOT, OKAY?

00:16:38.423 --> 00:16:41.008
Sinon: OKAY. THEN WHAT?

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.135
Kirito: THAT DEPENDS,

00:16:42.176 --> 00:16:44.137
BUT I'M NOT HERE FOR YOU.

00:16:44.178 --> 00:16:46.222
I'LL LEAVE AFTER, PROMISE.

00:16:46.264 --> 00:16:48.099
Sinon: THE MINUTE
YOU TURN YOUR BACK,

00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:49.183
I'LL BLOW YOU AWAY.

00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:50.893
Kirito: IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

00:16:50.935 --> 00:16:53.688
THEN FINE, BUT FOR NOW,
JUST STAY QUIET.

00:16:54.689 --> 00:16:56.357
Sinon: ALL RIGHT,

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.526
BUT AFTER THEY'RE DONE
DOWN THERE, IT'S YOU AND ME.

00:16:58.568 --> 00:16:59.569
Kirito: OKAY.

00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:12.999
Sinon: YOUR STEALTH SKILLS
ARE PRETTY PATHETIC.

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:20.840
I'M NOT LETTING HIM
LEAVE THE AREA ALIVE.

00:17:20.882 --> 00:17:23.551
IF HE MAKES A MOVE,
I'M TAKING THE SHOT.

00:17:23.593 --> 00:17:24.886
Kirito: HE'S ALL YOURS.

00:17:24.927 --> 00:17:26.471
WAIT. COMPANY.

00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:48.451
Dyne: EH? SON OF A...

00:17:48.493 --> 00:17:50.078
(CHUCKLES)

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.461
DAMN.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.591
Sinon: WHOA. HE'S FAST.

00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:06.052
HE BOOSTED
HIS THREE‐DIMENSIONAL MOBILITY

00:18:06.094 --> 00:18:08.137
BY CARRYING LIGHTER GEAR.

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:14.644
HIS ACROBATIC SKILLS
ARE THROUGH THE ROOF.

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:21.818
Dyne: BASTARD.

00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:25.613
(GROANS)

00:18:26.656 --> 00:18:28.032
(GUNSHOT)

00:18:33.162 --> 00:18:34.580
NO.

00:18:51.724 --> 00:18:54.226
Sinon: IF ONLY HE HAD TIME
TO SWITCH MAGS,

00:18:54.268 --> 00:18:57.229
HE COULD HAVE SHOT FROM THE HIP
AND KILLED HIM EASY.

00:18:57.271 --> 00:18:59.190
Kirito: THAT PALE GUY,

00:18:59.231 --> 00:19:02.652
HE'S QUICK AND POWERFUL.

00:19:02.693 --> 00:19:04.987
MAYBE HE'S THE ONE
IN THE CLOAK.

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:10.117
AN ENEMY. I THINK WE TRIED
TO KILL EACH OTHER ONCE BEFORE.

00:19:13.954 --> 00:19:15.581
Sinon: I'M TAKING HIM OUT.

00:19:15.623 --> 00:19:17.041
Kirito: OKAY,

00:19:17.083 --> 00:19:20.336
BUT IT WON'T BE EASY
IF HE'S WHO I THINK.

00:19:20.378 --> 00:19:21.671
Sinon: OH, PLEASE.

00:19:21.712 --> 00:19:24.340
HE CAN'T DODGE MY BULLET
AT THIS RANGE.

00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:27.176
Both: (GASP)

00:19:27.218 --> 00:19:29.136
(RIVER RUSHING)

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:36.341
Sinon: DID YOU HEAR A GUNSHOT?

00:19:36.383 --> 00:19:38.343
Kirito: THERE WASN'T ONE.

00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:40.387
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

00:19:40.428 --> 00:19:41.888
Sinon: TWO POSSIBILITIES.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.016
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LASER RIFLE
WITH A MUFFLED BLAST

00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:47.811
OR MAYBE A LIVE‐AMMO GUN
WITH A SILENCER.

00:19:47.852 --> 00:19:50.981
EITHER WAY,
IT WASN'T A KILL SHOT,

00:19:51.022 --> 00:19:52.816
SO WHY ISN'T HE MOVING?

00:19:52.857 --> 00:19:55.819
Kirito: I THINK THE SHOT
CAME FROM THE FOREST.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.947
Sinon: UH‐UH. HE WAS SNIPED
FROM FURTHER AWAY THAN THAT.

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:02.033
I DID A SCAN OF THE MAP
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:04.494
THERE'S NO ONE
WITHIN ONE KILOMETER OF HERE.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:06.496
AND NOW THAT WE'RE
ON THE SUBJECT,

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:08.790
YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHERE YOU CAME FROM?

00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:12.127
Kirito: UH, I WAS CHASING
AFTER THAT PALE RIDER GUY.

00:20:12.168 --> 00:20:13.628
HANG ON.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.754
OH, NO WAY.

00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:16.172
Sinon: WHAT'S UP?

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:18.091
Kirito: WHEN THE SATELLITE
WAS SCANNING THE AREA,

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:19.593
I WAS SWIMMING IN THAT RIVER.

00:20:19.634 --> 00:20:22.095
I GUESS MY LOCATION
DIDN'T REGISTER ON THE MAP

00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:23.555
'CAUSE I WAS UNDERWATER.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:25.765
Sinon: WITH ALL THAT GEAR,
YOU SHOULD HAVE DROWNED.

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:28.351
Kirito: NAH. I TOOK IT ALL OFF
BEFORE I DOVE IN,

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:29.728
STUCK IT IN MY ITEM STORAGE.

00:20:29.769 --> 00:20:31.187
Sinon: (SIGHS)

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:33.898
I NEVER KNEW
WE COULD USE THE RIVER

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.567
FOR COVER FROM THE SATELLITE.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:36.901
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

00:20:36.943 --> 00:20:38.570
I'LL KEEP IT IN MIND.

00:20:39.779 --> 00:20:42.032
Kirito: SINON,
CHECK OUT HIS SHOULDER.

00:20:42.073 --> 00:20:44.075
THERE'S A WEIRD LIGHT THERE.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.538
Sinon: A STUN BULLET.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.417
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:21:03.678 --> 00:21:05.764
HOW LONG'S HE BEEN THERE?

00:21:15.231 --> 00:21:16.941
Sinon: HE'S GOT
A SILENT ASSASSIN.

00:21:16.983 --> 00:21:19.069
Kirito: IS THAT
WHAT HIS RIFLE'S CALLED?

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.196
Sinon: YEAH.
IT'S A HIGH‐END SNIPER RIFLE

00:21:21.237 --> 00:21:23.531
THAT'S GOT
A BAD‐ASS SILENCER ON IT.

00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:27.160
I HEARD RUMORS
ABOUT THERE BEING ONE IN GGO,

00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:30.205
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.

00:21:30.246 --> 00:21:32.207
IF HE CAN HANDLE THAT GUN,

00:21:32.248 --> 00:21:35.168
HE MUST BE SOME PLAYER.

00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:50.558
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.268
Sinon: WHY WOULD HE
USE HIS HANDGUN

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.311
TO FINISH HIM OFF?

00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:57.565
Kirito: SINON, SHOOT.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:21:58.900
Sinon: HUH? WHICH ONE?

00:21:58.942 --> 00:22:00.652
Kirito: IT'S THE GUY
IN THE CLOAK.

00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:02.320
THERE'S NO TIME! SHOOT HIM!

00:22:02.362 --> 00:22:03.780
HURRY!

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.615
DON'T LET HIM FIRE THAT GUN!
