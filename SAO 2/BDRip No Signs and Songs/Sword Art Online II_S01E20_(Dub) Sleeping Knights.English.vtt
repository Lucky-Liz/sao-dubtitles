WEBVTT

00:00:02.884 --> 00:00:04.219
Yuuki: HEY, GUYS!

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.929
THIS IS MISS ASUNA.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.350
MISS ASUNA, THIS IS MY GUILD,
THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS!

00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:11.684
Jun: MY NAME'S JUN.

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:13.520
WHAT'S UP? HOW'S IT GOING?

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.022
Talken: H‐HI, MISS ASUNA.

00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:17.774
I‐I'M TALKEN.

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:19.442
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU‐‐

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:20.610
AH!

00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:22.362
Nori: YOU REALLY NEED
TO GET A GRIP

00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:24.072
ON THOSE NERVES, TAL, SERIOUSLY.

00:00:24.113 --> 00:00:27.784
EVERY TIME YOU MEET A GIRL,
YOU TURN INTO A BLUBBERING MESS.

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:29.202
ANYWAY, MY NAME'S NORI.

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:30.537
GLAD TO MEET YA.

00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:32.038
Siune: MY NAME IS SIUNE.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.540
IT'S WONDERFUL TO MEET YOU,

00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:35.750
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING TODAY.

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:37.460
Tecchi: IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:38.461
MY NAME'S TECCHI.

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:40.547
Yuuki: AND...

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:43.341
I'M YUUKI, THE LEADER
OF THIS GUILD, KINDA, SORTA.

00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:46.052
MISS ASUNA, DON'T LAUGH,

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:48.346
BUT SEE,
WE WANNA BE THE ONLY GUILD

00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:50.306
TO BEAT THE BOSS ON THIS FLOOR,

00:00:50.348 --> 00:00:52.058
AND WE WANT YOU TO HELP US!

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.977
Asuna: HUH?

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:55.019
(GASPS)

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:56.521
HUH?!

00:00:56.562 --> 00:00:58.022
Yuuki: (CHUCKLES)

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.037
Asuna: THAT'S VERY AMBITIOUS,

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.123
BUT A BOSS RAID USUALLY TAKES
AT LEAST FORTY‐NINE PLAYERS.

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:39.376
THAT'S SEVEN PARTIES
WITH SEVEN PLAYERS APIECE,

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:41.670
SO NO MATTER
HOW SKILLED YOU ARE,

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:43.672
WITH JUST SEVEN PLAYERS,
THAT'S KIND OF‐‐

00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:46.132
WELL, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,
IT'S UNREALISTIC.

00:02:46.174 --> 00:02:48.551
Yuuki: YEAH,
IT SORTA IS, ISN'T IT?

00:02:48.593 --> 00:02:50.595
WE TRIED TAKING ON THE BOSSES

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.806
ON FLOOR TWENTY‐FIVE
AND ‐SIX THE SAME WAY.

00:02:52.847 --> 00:02:54.474
Asuna: HUH?! J‐JUST YOU SIX?

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:56.017
Yuuki: YUP.

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.729
AND IF YOU ASK ME, WE PUT UP
A PRETTY GOOD FIGHT, TOO,

00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:01.940
BUT BOTH TIMES,
THIS HUGE GUILD SWOOPED IN

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:05.026
AND BEAT 'EM BEFORE WE
COULD FIGURE OUT OUR NEXT MOVE.

00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:07.529
Asuna: WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN RISK IT?

00:03:08.571 --> 00:03:10.281
Siune: THAT'S A STORY.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:13.368
IT GOES BACK TO WHEN WE MET
IN ANOTHER GAME'S NET COMMUNITY.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.496
WE HIT IT OFF RIGHT AWAY, AND
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS EVER SINCE.

00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:19.082
BUT WE ONLY HAVE
UNTIL NEXT SPRING

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:21.793
TO GO ON QUESTS TOGETHER.
SINCE OUR TIME'S LIMITED,

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:24.754
WE WANTED
TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:26.923
YOU SEE, COME SPRING,

00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:29.134
WE'LL ALL
BE BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS,

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:31.761
SO WE DECIDED THAT BEFORE
WE DISBANDED THE GUILD,

00:03:31.803 --> 00:03:33.805
WE HAD TO DO
SOMETHING SO AMAZING,

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:35.390
SO UNBELIEVABLE
WE'D REMEMBER IT FOREVER.

00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:36.975
Nori: MM‐HMM.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.978
Asuna: SO THAT'S WHY YOU
WANT TO DO THIS BOSS RAID.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.272
Siune: EXACTLY!
IF WE DEFEAT A BOSS TOGETHER,

00:03:42.313 --> 00:03:45.442
OUR NAMES WILL BE INSCRIBED
ON THE MONUMENT OF SWORDSMEN,

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:47.819
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
IN THE TOWN OF BEGINNINGS,

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.154
IN THE BLACK IRON PALACE.

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.448
I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.450
AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE VAIN,

00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:55.618
BUT WE REALLY WANT
TO GET OUR NAMES

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.579
UP ON THAT WALL, NO MATTER WHAT.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.581
BUT GETTING THEM ON THERE'S
THE HARD PART.

00:03:59.622 --> 00:04:00.832
Asuna: HMM?

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:03.293
Siune: IF A BOSS
IS DEFEATED BY A PARTY,

00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:04.794
THEN ALL OF ITS MEMBERS

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:06.796
WILL GET THEIR NAMES
INSCRIBED ON THE MONUMENT,

00:04:06.838 --> 00:04:09.799
BUT IF IT'S BEATEN BY MULTIPLE
PARTIES WORKING IN TANDEM,

00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:12.760
ONLY THE NAMES OF
THE PARTY LEADERS GET INSCRIBED.

00:04:12.802 --> 00:04:13.928
Asuna: OH.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.013
Siune: THAT'S THE CATCH.

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.973
IF WE WANT
THE NAMES OF EVERYONE

00:04:17.015 --> 00:04:18.725
IN THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS
UP ON THAT WALL,

00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:23.688
WE HAVE TO BEAT THE BOSS
TOGETHER, JUST US, NO ONE ELSE,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.149
SO WE TALKED IT OVER
AND CAME UP WITH A PLAN.

00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:29.068
A PARTY CAN HAVE
UP TO SEVEN PLAYERS MAX,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.363
THEREFORE WE DECIDED
TO FIND SOMEONE AS STRONG

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:35.950
OR EVEN STRONGER THAN
OUR MOST POWERFUL PLAYER, YUUKI,

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:39.537
AND HOPE WHOEVER WE FOUND
ACCEPTED OUR INVITATION.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:42.081
Asuna: I GET IT.
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE DUELING.

00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:45.710
Siune: WELL? WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT JOINING UP WITH US?

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.462
WE CAN'T PAY YOU VERY MUCH,

00:04:47.504 --> 00:04:49.172
BUT YOU'RE WELCOME
TO WHAT WE HAVE.

00:04:49.214 --> 00:04:51.508
Asuna: UH, OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY!

00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:53.760
BOSS RAIDS
COST A FORTUNE AS IT IS,

00:04:53.802 --> 00:04:55.845
SO YOU SHOULD USE
YOUR MONEY FOR THAT.

00:04:55.887 --> 00:04:57.806
I'D FEEL HORRIBLE
TAKING YOUR MONEY, REALLY.

00:04:57.847 --> 00:05:00.892
IF YOU WANT, YOU COULD GIVE ME
WHATEVER THE BOSS DROPS,

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:02.310
AND I'LL BE FINE.

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:04.270
Siune: REALLY?!
THEN YOU'LL JOIN OUR PARTY?

00:05:04.312 --> 00:05:06.314
Sleeping Knights: (LAUGHING)

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.703
Asuna: HUH.

00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:24.791
(THINKING) THIS IS NOTHING
LIKE HOW THE OLD AINCRAD WAS,

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:26.584
AND YET HERE I AM

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:31.798
THINKING ABOUT SAFETY MARGINS
AND THE ODDS OF WINNING,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.009
HAVING SAFE FIGHTS
AND CERTAIN VICTORIES.

00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:38.388
THERE'S MORE FUN
TO GAMES THAN THAT.

00:05:40.723 --> 00:05:44.727
I BET YUUKI AND HER FRIENDS
ALREADY KNOW THIS

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:46.354
BETTER THAN I DO.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.735
OKAY, LET'S SEE
HOW FAR WE CAN GO.

00:05:52.777 --> 00:05:54.320
‐ Jun: YES!
‐ Tecchi: AWESOME.

00:05:54.362 --> 00:05:55.864
Asuna: IN THE END, IT'S NOT
ABOUT WINNING OR LOSING.

00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:56.990
IT'S HAVING FU‐‐

00:05:57.031 --> 00:05:57.991
Yuuki: THANKS A BUNCH,
MISS ASUNA!

00:05:58.032 --> 00:06:00.618
Asuna: (CHUCKLES) PLEASE,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.079
I‐I'D PREFER IT IF YOU
JUST CALLED ME ASUNA.

00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:05.164
Yuuki: (GIGGLES)
THEN YOU CAN CALL ME YUUKI.

00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:07.000
Nori: SO, WHAT DO YA THINK?
SHE'S CUTE, HUH?

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.378
Asuna: THAT REMINDS ME,
MS. YUUKI‐‐SORRY, YUUKI...

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.797
THE DUEL WAS ALL ABOUT
TESTING PLAYERS, RIGHT?

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.048
Yuuki: YUP. PRETTY MUCH.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.842
THEN YOU MUST'VE GONE UP AGAINST

00:06:15.884 --> 00:06:18.469
A TON OF STRONG PLAYERS
BEFORE I SHOWED UP.

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:21.931
DO YOU REMEMBER EVER FIGHTING
A SPRIGGAN, DRESSED IN BLACK?

00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:24.893
HE WOULD'VE BEEN USING
A ONE‐HANDED SWORD.

00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:26.394
Yuuki: HUH.

00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:28.146
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DO.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.523
MAN, HE WAS PRETTY TOUGH.

00:06:30.565 --> 00:06:33.776
Asuna: THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
ASK HIM TO HELP YOU OUT?

00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:36.112
Yuuki: MM, I DON'T KNOW.

00:06:36.154 --> 00:06:37.447
HE JUST WASN'T RIGHT.

00:06:37.488 --> 00:06:39.157
Asuna: WELL, WHY NOT?

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.576
Yuuki: HE FOUND OUT MY SECRET.

00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:43.202
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

00:06:46.664 --> 00:06:48.625
Asuna: OKAY, SO FOR TOMORROW,

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:50.376
HOW 'BOUT WE MEET
BACK HERE AT 1:00?

00:06:50.418 --> 00:06:52.003
‐ Jun: YOU GOT IT!
‐ Yuuki: YOU GOT IT!

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:53.630
‐ Tecchi: ROGER THAT.
‐ Siune: WHAT THEY SAID.

00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:55.006
Asuna: AND LET'S HAVE FUN.

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:56.049
Sleeping Dragons: RIGHT!

00:07:01.512 --> 00:07:04.015
Asuna: (CHUCKLES)

00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:10.980
(SIGHS)

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.570
(THRUMMING)

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:26.120
(GASPS)

00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:30.833
(SIGHING)

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.381
(GASPS)

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:38.216
WH‐‐

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:41.010
MOM? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.973
Kyoko: LAST MONTH,
WHEN YOU WERE LATE FOR DINNER,

00:07:46.015 --> 00:07:48.101
I TOLD YOU
IT BETTER NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:07:48.142 --> 00:07:49.519
AND HERE WE ARE.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.937
YOU'RE LATE
BECAUSE OF THAT GAME,

00:07:50.978 --> 00:07:52.855
SO NOW YOU LOSE YOUR PRIVILEGES.

00:07:52.897 --> 00:07:54.899
Asuna: I JUST
LOST TRACK OF TIME.

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.651
THAT'S MY FAULT, AND I'M SORRY.

00:07:56.693 --> 00:07:59.445
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO AND
PULL THE PLUG ON ME LIKE THAT.

00:07:59.487 --> 00:08:02.240
YOU COULD'VE SHAKEN ME
OR EVEN YELLED IN MY EAR.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:03.783
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN
AN ALERT IN‐GAME,

00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:05.076
AND THEN
I COULD'VE LOGGED OUT‐‐

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:06.577
Kyoko: I TRIED
THAT APPROACH BEFORE.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:09.455
IT TOOK YOU FIVE MINUTES
TO SNAP OUT OF IT, REMEMBER?

00:08:09.497 --> 00:08:10.957
Asuna: WELL, YEAH.

00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:13.501
I HAD TO SAY GOOD‐BYE
TO EVERYONE BEFORE I LOG‐‐

00:08:13.543 --> 00:08:14.919
Kyoko: OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.921
WHAT YOU DO
IN SOME STUPID VIRTUAL GAME

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:18.297
DOES NOT TAKE PRIORITY

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:21.426
OVER YOUR COMMITMENTS
IN THE REAL WORLD, EVER.

00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:26.305
Asuna: I'M SORRY.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.226
I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME.

00:08:30.268 --> 00:08:32.603
Kyoko: THIS WILL BE
YOUR LAST WARNING.

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:36.149
IF YOU BREAK YOUR WORD TO ME
BECAUSE OF THAT THING AGAIN,

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.734
I'M CONFISCATING IT.

00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:40.611
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THAT HEAD OF YOURS.

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.947
YOU LOST TWO YEARS OF YOUR LIFE

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.241
BECAUSE OF THAT‐‐
THAT INFERNAL MACHINE.

00:08:45.283 --> 00:08:46.409
YOU COULD'VE DIED.

00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:50.038
HOW CAN YOU EVEN STAND
TO LOOK AT IT?

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:51.247
Asuna: (SIGHS)

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:54.125
THIS ISN'T THE NERVEGEAR,
MOTHER.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.423
Kyoko: IT'S DINNERTIME.

00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:03.593
GET CHANGED,
AND COME DOWNSTAIRS.

00:09:03.634 --> 00:09:05.428
Asuna: I'M NOT HUNGRY.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.889
Kyoko: AS YOU WISH.

(SHUDDERS)

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:41.798
HMM.

00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:26.636
Yuuki: SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD LINEUP, RIGHT?

00:10:27.637 --> 00:10:29.388
HUH? ASUNA.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.723
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:35.561
UH, S‐SO YUUKI, JUN,
AND TECCHI ARE UP FRONT.

00:10:35.603 --> 00:10:37.730
THEN TALKEN AND NORI
ARE MIDRANGE,

00:10:37.772 --> 00:10:40.149
AND SIUNE,
YOU'RE THE BACKUP? RIGHT.

00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:42.151
THEN I GUESS, IF YOU'RE COVERED,

00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:44.695
MAYBE I SHOULD HANG BACK
AS THE REARGUARD.

00:10:44.737 --> 00:10:47.323
Yuuki: YEAH, SORRY.
I FEEL BAD YOU'RE NOT UP FRONT

00:10:47.365 --> 00:10:49.158
WHEN YOU'RE SO GOOD
WITH A SWORD.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.660
Asuna: OH, I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.620
I'M AFRAID
I'M NOT MUCH GOOD AS A TANK.

00:10:52.662 --> 00:10:56.332
AND ANYWAY, I'M CURIOUS
TO SEE WHETHER JUN AND TECCHI

00:10:56.374 --> 00:10:58.084
CAN SURVIVE A PROPER BEATDOWN.

00:10:58.125 --> 00:10:59.043
Both: (STAMMER)

00:10:59.085 --> 00:11:00.252
Jun: DON'T WORRY ABOUT US!

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:01.253
WE CAN HANDLE IT.

00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:02.922
Asuna: I GUESS WE'LL SEE.

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:03.923
Jun: I HOPE.

00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:05.216
Sleeping Dragons: (LAUGH)

00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:10.054
Asuna: ALL RIGHT, READY TO GO
TAKE A PEEK AT THAT BOSS ROOM?

00:11:10.096 --> 00:11:11.764
Sleeping Dragons: YEAH!

00:11:13.015 --> 00:11:15.017
(WEAPONS CLASHING)

(LAUGHTER)

00:11:25.194 --> 00:11:26.487
Asuna: WHAT A TEAM.

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:29.240
I WONDER IF THEY
REALLY NEED ME AFTER ALL.

00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:30.241
(SIGHS)

00:11:30.282 --> 00:11:32.201
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY

00:11:32.243 --> 00:11:34.203
YOU GUYS
ARE CLEARING THE LABYRINTH.

00:11:34.245 --> 00:11:36.664
YOU'RE AN AMAZING GROUP
OF PLAYERS.

00:11:36.706 --> 00:11:37.665

(GASPS)

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.670
IT'S THE BOSS ROOM! COME ON!

00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:46.340
Asuna: YUUKI, HOLD IT!

00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:51.470
Yuuki: (GASPS)

00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:16.829
LOOK!

00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:18.748
Players: (GASPING)

00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:21.500

00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:23.502
HANG ON!
WE'RE NOT HERE TO FIGHT YOU!

00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:25.004
Asuna: THEN LOWER
YOUR WEAPONS NOW!

00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:26.255
Player: GET RID OF IT.

00:12:26.297 --> 00:12:27.757
Asuna: KEEP YOUR EYE ON THEM,

00:12:27.798 --> 00:12:30.050
AND IF THEY MAKE A MOVE
FOR THEIR WEAPONS,

00:12:30.092 --> 00:12:32.136
HIT 'EM
WITH AN AQUA BIND SPELL.

00:12:32.178 --> 00:12:33.804
Siune: YOU GOT IT. (LAUGHS)

00:12:33.846 --> 00:12:36.474
THIS IS OUR
FIRST‐EVER P.V.P. IN A.L.O.

00:12:36.515 --> 00:12:38.517
IT'S KIND OF THRILLING.

00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:41.187
Asuna: IF YOU'RE NOT PK‐ers,

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.189
THEN WHY WERE
YOU HIDING FROM US?

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.149
Player: WE WERE
WAITING FOR SOMEONE.

00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:47.693
WE WERE HIDING, 'CAUSE WE
DIDN'T WANNA GET HIT BY A MOB

00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:49.820
BEFORE OUR FRIENDS GOT HERE.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

00:12:51.197 --> 00:12:53.115
‐ Asuna: ALL RIGHT, THEN.
‐ Player 2: (SIGHS)

00:12:53.157 --> 00:12:54.992
Asuna: WE'RE HERE
TO TAKE ON THE BOSS,

00:12:55.034 --> 00:12:57.119
SO IF YOU'RE NOT READY
TO ENTER YET,

00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:59.538
WE'D LIKE
TO TAKE A CRACK AT IT FIRST.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.081
Player 1: N‐NO, THAT'S COOL.

00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:07.880
WE'LL JUST HANG HERE,

00:13:07.922 --> 00:13:10.090
YOU KNOW,
TILL OUR BUDDIES SHOW UP.

00:13:10.132 --> 00:13:12.718
OH, AND, UH,
WATCH YOUR BACKS IN THERE.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.345
GOOD LUCK.

00:13:14.386 --> 00:13:18.432

OH‐BIS, GLONE, LOPT!

Jun: DON'T GIVE THOSE DUDES
A SECOND THOUGHT.

00:13:20.184 --> 00:13:21.393
COME ON. LET'S DO THIS.

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:23.395
‐ Yuuki: HMM.
‐ Asuna: DON'T WORRY.

00:13:23.437 --> 00:13:26.315
LET'S JUST STICK TO THE PLAN
AND HAVE A LOOK INSIDE, OKAY?

00:13:26.357 --> 00:13:27.358
Yuuki: OKAY.

00:13:28.526 --> 00:13:30.152
Jun: INSTEAD OF
JUST SCOPING IT OUT,

00:13:30.194 --> 00:13:32.279
LET'S BUST IN THERE
AND TRASH THE BOSS.

00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:34.615
Asuna: IF YOU WANT TO TRY,
GO FOR IT.

00:13:34.657 --> 00:13:36.242
JUST MAKE SURE NOT TO USE

00:13:36.283 --> 00:13:38.702
ANY OF YOUR EXPENSIVE POTIONS
AND STUFF TO RECOVER.

00:13:38.744 --> 00:13:41.205
SIUNE AND I WILL SUPPORT YOU
WITH HEALING SPELLS,

00:13:41.247 --> 00:13:44.458
SO FIGHT HARD, BUT TRY
NOT TO GET TOO FAR IN THE RED.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.377
Jun: HA! RIGHT ON, COACH! UHH!

00:13:46.418 --> 00:13:47.378
(LAUGHTER)

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:48.671
Asuna: LISTEN UP.

00:13:48.712 --> 00:13:50.464
IF YOU DIE,
DON'T RESPAWN RIGHT AWAY.

00:13:50.506 --> 00:13:53.092
JUST HANG OUT, AND STUDY
THE BOSS' ATTACK PATTERNS.

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:55.636
THEN LET'S MEET BACK
AT THE LOMBARD SAVE POINT

00:13:55.678 --> 00:13:57.555
AND TALK ABOUT
WHAT WE LEARNED, OKAY?

00:13:57.596 --> 00:13:58.722
Sleeping Knights: ROGER THAT!

00:14:00.432 --> 00:14:02.434
(DOORS CREAKING)

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.598
Boss: (ROARING)

00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:47.980
Asuna: LET'S GET HIM!

00:14:48.022 --> 00:14:49.398
Sleeping Knights: RIGHT!

00:14:53.902 --> 00:14:56.572
Nori: JEEZ!
WE GOT OUR BUTTS KICKED!

00:14:56.614 --> 00:14:58.365
WHAT KINDA ATTACK WAS THAT?

00:14:58.407 --> 00:15:01.035
THAT'S GOTTA BE
AGAINST THE RULES!

00:15:01.076 --> 00:15:03.078
Tecchi: THAT BOSS SURE KNOWS
HOW TO DEFEND ITSELF.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.496
YOU THINK THAT'S A RANDOM MOVE,

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:05.998
USING HIS ARMS TO BLOCK?

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.877
Yuuki: (GROANS)
AND WE FOUGHT SO HARD, TOO.

00:15:09.918 --> 00:15:10.878
HEY! WHAT'S WRONG?!

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:12.171
‐ Tecchi: HMM?
‐ Jun: HMM?

00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:13.922
Asuna: COME HERE, YOU GUYS.
GATHER ROUND.

00:15:13.964 --> 00:15:14.923
‐ Nori: EH?
‐ Siune: EH?

00:15:14.965 --> 00:15:16.342
Asuna: I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED,

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:17.801
BUT WE NEED TO TALK.

00:15:19.303 --> 00:15:22.139
REMEMBER THOSE THREE GUYS
STANDING BY THE BOSS ROOM?

00:15:22.181 --> 00:15:23.307
Siune: SURE. WHY?

00:15:23.349 --> 00:15:24.933
Asuna: THEY WERE SCOUTS
FROM A GUILD

00:15:24.975 --> 00:15:26.060
THAT SPECIALIZES IN BOSS RAIDS.

00:15:26.101 --> 00:15:27.561
Sleeping Knights: (GASP)

00:15:27.603 --> 00:15:30.064
Asuna: IF ANOTHER GUILD
TRIES TO HIT THAT BOSS ROOM,

00:15:30.105 --> 00:15:32.524
THEIR JOB
IS TO SIT BACK AND WATCH.

00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:34.193
THE BOSSES YOU TRIED TO RAID

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.612
ON THE PREVIOUS FLOOR
AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT,

00:15:36.654 --> 00:15:38.781
I HAVE A FEELING
THEY WERE THERE, TOO.

00:15:38.822 --> 00:15:41.283
Siune: I HAD NO IDEA
THEY WERE EVEN THERE.

00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:44.244
Asuna: THEY DIDN'T GET
IN OUR WAY OR TRY TO STOP US,

00:15:44.286 --> 00:15:46.455
SO THEY'RE DEFINITELY SPIES.
ALL THEY WANT IS INTEL.

00:15:46.497 --> 00:15:48.999
AND WHEN A SMALL GUILD
LIKE THE SLEEPING KNIGHTS

00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:50.709
COMES ALONG TO TAKE ON A BOSS,

00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:52.503
WE'RE HELPING THEM FIGURE OUT

00:15:52.544 --> 00:15:54.880
ALL ITS ATTACK PATTERNS
AND WEAKNESSES.

00:15:54.922 --> 00:15:56.382
Talken: WAIT A SEC.

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:58.634
THE DOOR SHUT BEHIND US
WHEN WE WERE INSIDE,

00:15:58.676 --> 00:16:00.177
AND THEY DEFINITELY
DIDN'T FOLLOW US,

00:16:00.219 --> 00:16:02.930
SO IF THEY CAN'T SEE US
FIGHTING THE BOSS,

00:16:02.971 --> 00:16:05.599
HOW ARE THEY GONNA GATHER
ANY INTEL ON IT?

00:16:05.641 --> 00:16:07.726
Asuna: ACTUALLY,
THEY COULD SEE US FIGHT.

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:09.895
TOWARDS THE END THERE,
I LOOKED OVER,

00:16:09.937 --> 00:16:12.398
AND I SAW A TINY GRAY LIZARD
NEAR JUN'S FEET.

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:15.150
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
I LET MY GUARD DOWN TOO SOON.

00:16:15.192 --> 00:16:17.653
IT'S A DARK SPELL
CALLED PEEPING.

00:16:17.695 --> 00:16:19.613
IT BINDS A FAMILIAR TO A PLAYER,

00:16:19.655 --> 00:16:21.824
AND THE CASTER SEES
WHAT IT SEES.

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:27.329
Yuuki: SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS AFTER WE GOT HAMMERED

00:16:27.371 --> 00:16:29.998
BY THE BOSSES
ON FLOORS TWENTY‐FIVE AND ‐SIX,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.543
THAT OTHER GUILD
SWOOPING IN AND BEATING 'EM,

00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:34.503
THAT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE?

00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:36.255
Asuna: NO, I'M AFRAID IT WASN'T.

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:37.798
YOU PROBABLY FOUGHT SO HARD,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.967
THE BOSS USED
EVERY MOVE IT HAD AGAINST YOU,

00:16:40.008 --> 00:16:41.385
AND THEY SAW IT ALL.

00:16:41.427 --> 00:16:43.387
THAT'S HOW THEY BEAT
THE BOSSES SO QUICKLY.

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:46.974
Siune: THEY USED US AGAIN.

00:16:47.015 --> 00:16:49.810
NOW THEY KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS BOSS, TOO.

00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:53.564
THEY'RE PROBABLY IN THERE
TAKING IT DOWN.

00:16:53.605 --> 00:16:55.149
Nori: THOSE DICKS.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.191
Jun: DAMN IT.

00:16:56.233 --> 00:16:57.735
Asuna: EASY, GUYS.

00:16:57.776 --> 00:17:00.320
DON'T COUNT US OUT JUST YET.

00:17:00.362 --> 00:17:02.823
Yuuki: BUT WHAT CAN WE DO
ABOUT IT NOW?

00:17:02.865 --> 00:17:05.617
Asuna: SIMPLE. IT'S 2:30 P.M.
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:08.662
AT THIS TIME OF DAY
AND ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE,

00:17:08.704 --> 00:17:11.832
IT'LL BE HARD TO FIND
ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR A RAID PARTY.

00:17:11.874 --> 00:17:15.043
BY MY ESTIMATE, IT SHOULD
TAKE THEM AT LEAST AN HOUR.

00:17:15.085 --> 00:17:16.962
THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME FOR US.

00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:19.423
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.
AFTER THIS,

00:17:19.465 --> 00:17:21.800
IF WE CAN GET BACK TO THAT ROOM
IN THIRTY MINUTES,

00:17:21.842 --> 00:17:22.801
WE CAN TAKE IT.

00:17:22.843 --> 00:17:24.386
OKAY?

00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:28.182
Sleeping Knights: (LAUGHING)

00:17:28.223 --> 00:17:30.100
Yuuki: YEAH!

00:17:34.565 --> 00:17:37.317
Jun: LAST ONE THERE'S
A ROTTEN EGG! (LAUGHS)

00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:39.361
Yuuki: HEY! WAIT FOR US!

00:17:39.403 --> 00:17:40.529
Jun: SLOWPOKE!

00:17:40.571 --> 00:17:41.822
‐ Asuna: (laughs)
‐ Siune: (laughs)

00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:45.576
Players: (MURMURING)

00:17:45.617 --> 00:17:48.745
Yuuki: CRAP! WE'RE TOO LATE.

00:17:50.247 --> 00:17:51.582
(SIGHS)

00:17:51.623 --> 00:17:53.041
Asuna: DON'T WORRY.

00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:55.127
THEY WON'T ADVANCE
WITH ONLY TWENTY PLAYERS.

00:17:55.168 --> 00:17:57.671
WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH TIME
TO GIVE IT ONE MORE TRY

00:17:57.713 --> 00:17:58.922
BEFORE THE REST SHOW UP.

00:17:58.964 --> 00:18:00.090
Yuuki: YOU THINK?

00:18:00.132 --> 00:18:02.050
‐ Asuna: EXCUSE ME!
