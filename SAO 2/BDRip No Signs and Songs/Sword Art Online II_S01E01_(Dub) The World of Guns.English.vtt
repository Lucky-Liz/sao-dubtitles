WEBVTT

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:17.942
XeXeeD: THESE PLAYERS WHO THINK
IT'S ALL ABOUT THEIR AGILITY‐‐

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:20.402
(LAUGHS)
MAN, THEY'RE LIVIN' IN A DREAM.

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:23.280
I MEAN, SURE, FIRING SPEED
AND EVASION ARE IMPORTANT,

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.241
AND TIME WAS, IF YOU
ROCKED THOSE TWO THINGS,

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:28.285
IT'S ALL YOU NEEDED
TO BE THE BEST.

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:29.286
'TIL NOW, THAT IS.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:30.913
YEAH, HATE TO SAY IT,

00:00:30.955 --> 00:00:32.831
BUT IT DON'T WORK
LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

00:00:32.873 --> 00:00:34.583
IN FACT, I GOT A MESSAGE
FOR THE FOLKS

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:36.252
WHO SPENT
THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS INDOORS

00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:38.796
BOOSTING THEIR AGI.

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:41.298
SUCKS TO BE YOU RIGHT NOW,
DON'T IT?

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.134
‐ Crowd: (ANGRY SHOUTS, BOOING)
‐ Player: YOU SUCK!

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:46.011
Moderator: NOW THAT'S THE KIND
OF COMMENT WE'D EXPECT

00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:48.138
FROM THE TOP PLAYER
OF "GUN GALE ONLINE,"

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.516
ONE OF THE MOST
CHALLENGING VRMMOs!

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:52.309
TALK ABOUT CONTROVERSIAL!

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.602
XeXeeD: I GUESS,
BUT WHO KNOWS

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:55.229
IF I'LL BE
ON "MMO STREAM" AGAIN,

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:56.981
SO MIGHT AS WELL STIR THINGS UP!

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:59.400
Moderator: OH, PLEASE!
SO, DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE A SHOT

00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:00.901
IN THE UPCOMING
BULLET OF BULLETS?

00:01:00.943 --> 00:01:03.195
XeXeeD: DAMN RIGHT, HONEY.
I WOULDN'T BE IN IT

00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:05.155
IF I DIDN'T THINK
I COULD WIN IT!

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:07.116
Crowd: (BOOING)

00:01:07.157 --> 00:01:09.743
Yamikaze: IT WON'T BE
THAT EASY, XEXEED.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:12.621
THE B.o.B.'S A SOLO TOURNEY,
SO IT'S WAY DIFFERENT.

00:01:12.663 --> 00:01:15.916
WHAT WORKED FOR YOU UP TO NOW,
DOESN'T MEAN IT'LL WORK AGAIN.

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.253
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T CHALK
MY WINS UP TO MY STATUS TYPE.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:21.422
XeXeeD: YEAH, WELL,
IF ANYTHING, MY RESULTS

00:01:21.463 --> 00:01:24.508
POINT TO SOME BIG CHANGES
HAPPENIN' IN G.G.O.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.552
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT AGI, YAMIKAZE.

00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:28.429
GO FIGURE YOU'D BE IN DENIAL.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.471
Yamikaze: (GROANS)

00:01:29.513 --> 00:01:31.307
XeXeeD: WAKE UP, PEOPLE!

00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:34.351
'TIL NOW, THE BEST STRATEGY
WAS BOOSTING YOUR AGI

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:36.895
AND SHOOTING A POWERFUL GUN
AS FAST AS YOU COULD,

00:01:36.937 --> 00:01:38.480
BUT THE REALITY IS,

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:41.275
THE BALANCE OF GAME PLAY
IN AN MMO IS ALWAYS CHANGING,

00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:42.943
ESPECIALLY IN GAMES
LIKE THIS ONE,

00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:45.612
WITH LEVELS THAT DON'T LET YOU
RE‐SPEC YOUR STATS.

00:01:45.654 --> 00:01:49.158
YOU HAVE TO THINK AHEAD AND BE
SMART WHEN USING YOUR POINTS,

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:51.243
'CAUSE THE BEST WEAPON
IN ONE LEVEL ZONE,

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:53.078
MIGHT NOT WORK FOR YOU
IN THE NEXT.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.456
BESIDES, THE NEW GUNS COMIN' OUT

00:01:55.497 --> 00:01:57.416
ARE GONNA HAVE
HIGHER STRENGTH REQUIREMENTS

00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.001
AND ACCURACY BONUSES.

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:00.753
(CHUCKLES)

00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:03.172
Player #2: (SCOFFS)
YOU REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS TALKING

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:05.674
'BOUT HOW GREAT
BEIN' AN AGI‐TYPE WAS?

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:08.552
THAT DICK TOTALLY SCAMMED US.

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:10.429
Players: (MURMURING)

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.477
Player #3: YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A FAKE, XEXEED,

00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:20.522
AND NOW YOU'LL FACE JUDGMENT
FROM SOMEONE WITH REAL POWER.

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:25.611
Players: (LAUGHING)

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.289
XeXeeD: ALL I'M SAYIN' IS

00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:38.832
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
IN THE END

00:02:38.874 --> 00:02:42.753
IS THE PLAYER'S ABILITY TO‐‐
(GASPING)

00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:51.762
Moderator: UH‐OH.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.014
I GUESS WE HAVE
A BAD CONNECTION HERE.

00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:56.517
DON'T WORRY, FOLKS.
I'M SURE HE'LL BE BACK SHORTLY.

00:02:56.558 --> 00:02:59.978
STAY TUNED
FOR MORE "MMO STREAM."

00:03:01.188 --> 00:03:03.023
Players: (GASPING)

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:06.860
Player #3: THIS IS REAL POWER,
REAL STRENGTH!

00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:11.240
LET YOUR FEAR CARVE
ONE NAME INTO YOUR BRAINS...

00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:13.826
THE NAME I SHARE
WITH THIS WEAPON...

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:15.828
DEATH GUN!

00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:36.767
Asuna: DECEMBER SEVENTH, 2025.

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.395
HAS IT ALREADY BEEN A YEAR?

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.527
(GASPS)

00:03:48.237 --> 00:03:52.616
I WONDER WHAT THE DIFFERENCE
IS BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD...

00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:53.659
AND THE VIRTUAL.

00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:56.829
Kazuto: THE AMOUNT OF DATA.
THAT'S ALL.

00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:59.248
Asuna: (GASPS)

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.000
YOU SCARED ME.

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:02.501
Kazuto: SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:03.586
I'M ON TIME, THOUGH.

00:04:03.627 --> 00:04:05.087
(GIGGLES) WHAT?

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.338
Asuna: (GIGGLES)

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.424
NO, I'M SORRY.
I WAS SPACING OUT.

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:09.675
ANYWAY...

00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:12.386
HELLO, KIRITO.
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?!

00:04:12.428 --> 00:04:16.766
Kazuto: IT'S BEEN GOOD SO FAR,
BUT IT'S EVEN BETTER NOW.

00:04:16.807 --> 00:04:18.642
Asuna: WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

00:04:18.684 --> 00:04:20.978
Kazuto: NOTHING! JUST...

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.813
THAT OUTFIT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:24.899
IT BRINGS BACK
A LOT OF MEMORIES.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.817
Asuna: I GUESS IT DOES.

00:04:26.859 --> 00:04:28.652
NO RAPIER, THOUGH.

00:04:28.694 --> 00:04:31.697
LOOKS LIKE YOU WENT OVERBOARD
ON THE BLACK TODAY.

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:33.115
Kazuto: YEAH!

00:04:33.157 --> 00:04:35.201
SUGU THREW EVERYTHING
IN THE WASH THIS MORNING,

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:36.660
AND THIS IS ALL I HAD LEFT.

00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:38.746
Asuna: THEN STOP
PUTTING YOUR LAUNDRY OFF.

00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:41.290
‐ Kazuto: (SIGHS)
‐ Asuna: (LAUGHS)

00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:44.585
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE BOTH
DRESSED IN OUR OLD COLORS TODAY.

00:04:44.627 --> 00:04:46.420
‐ WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT?
‐ Kazuto: WELL...

00:04:46.462 --> 00:04:48.923
IF WE SEE EACH OTHER
EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR, IT'S‐‐

00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:50.716
Asuna: STOP. THAT WAS
A RHETORICAL QUESTION,

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:52.384
SMARTY‐PANTS. COME ON.

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:54.220
Kazuto: OKAY, OKAY.

00:04:56.847 --> 00:04:58.307
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.559
BUT I THINK THE IMPERIAL PALACE
IS INTERESTING.

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:04.104
Asuna: INTERESTING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:05:04.146 --> 00:05:06.398
Kazuto: IT'S TWO KILOMETERS
NORTH TO SOUTH,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.150
1.5 EAST TO WEST,

00:05:08.192 --> 00:05:10.444
AND IT TAKES UP
20% OF CHIYODA WARD.

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:12.780
THERE AREN'T ANY SUBWAYS
OR TUNNELS UNDER IT,

00:05:12.822 --> 00:05:14.532
AND IT'S A NO‐FLY ZONE.

00:05:14.573 --> 00:05:16.826
IT'S KINDA COOL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:18.410
I MEAN, IT'S THIS
BIG RESTRICTED AREA

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:20.496
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TOKYO.

00:05:20.538 --> 00:05:23.374
NOT ONLY IS IT CUT OFF
FROM EVERYTHING PHYSICALLY,

00:05:23.415 --> 00:05:25.251
BUT INFORMATION‐WISE AS WELL.

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:26.418
SEE THAT?

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.504
IT'S A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:31.632
THIS PLACE WAS SET UP WITH
ITS VERY OWN CLOSED NETWORK.

00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:33.843
YOU CAN'T EVEN ACCESS IT
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

00:05:33.884 --> 00:05:36.929
Asuna: WOW.
THAT'S A WEIRD‐LOOKING CAMERA.

00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:38.222
Kazuto: YEAH.

00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:40.683
NOT ONLY IS THIS PLACE
THE HEART OF TOKYO,

00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:43.018
BUT IT'S ALSO
AN ISOLATED WORLD OF ITS OWN.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.646
MAYBE I'M EXAGGERATING
ITS COOL FACTOR.

00:05:45.688 --> 00:05:47.690
‐ I GET LIKE THAT.
‐ Asuna: (GIGGLES) YOU THINK?

00:05:53.946 --> 00:05:55.197
WOW!

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:57.867
Kazuto: THIS USED TO BE
THE INNER CITADEL.

00:05:57.908 --> 00:05:59.410
Asuna: COME ON! LET'S GO!

00:06:03.372 --> 00:06:05.958
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:19.138
Asuna: HEY, YOU KNOW
THAT QUESTIONNAIRE

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:21.765
THEY GAVE US TO FILL OUT,
THE ONE ABOUT OUR FUTURE PLANS?

00:06:21.807 --> 00:06:23.559
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO YET?

00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.685
Kazuto: HMM.

00:06:24.727 --> 00:06:26.562
I GUESS, IF ANYTHING,

00:06:26.604 --> 00:06:28.939
I WANNA GO FROM PLAYING GAMES
TO BEING A CREATOR.

00:06:28.981 --> 00:06:30.608
Asuna: A CREATOR?

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:31.817
WHAT, FOR GAMES?

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:33.444
Kazuto: NO, NOT FOR GAMES.

00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:34.862
I WANNA MAKE
A HUMAN‐MACHINE INTERFACE

00:06:34.904 --> 00:06:37.698
TO REPLACE THE FULL‐DIVE TECH
WE USE NOW.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.199
I'VE BEEN GOIN'
TO ALL THESE TECH FORUMS

00:06:39.241 --> 00:06:40.784
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT,

00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:43.621
BUT IT'S A HECK OF A LOT
OF INFORMATION TO ABSORB.

00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:48.667
Asuna: AFTER I GRADUATE,
ALL I WANT IS TO BE WITH YOU.

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.502
‐ Kazuto: HUH?
‐ Asuna: I‐I MEAN...

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:51.920
I‐I WISH WE COULD
FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:06:51.962 --> 00:06:54.131
TO LIVE WITH YUI
IN THIS WORLD, TOO!

00:06:54.173 --> 00:06:56.258
Kazuto: WE'LL BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH HER SOMEDAY,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.593
AS SOON AS WE FIGURE OUT

00:06:57.635 --> 00:06:59.762
HOW TO ACCESS AUGMENTED REALITY
AT WILL.

00:06:59.803 --> 00:07:01.055
THE ONLY THING
STANDING IN THE WAY

00:07:01.096 --> 00:07:02.890
IS THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE AMOUNT OF DATA.

00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:06.018
Asuna: DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.436
THAT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN OUR WORLD

00:07:07.478 --> 00:07:09.980
AND THE VIRTUAL
WAS THE AMOUNT OF DATA?

00:07:10.022 --> 00:07:11.649
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, ANYWAY?

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.942
Kazuto: LET'S SEE.
IT'S LIKE THIS.

00:07:13.984 --> 00:07:16.403
IF WE WERE HOLDING HANDS
IN A.L.O.,

00:07:16.445 --> 00:07:19.657
IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME
AS IN THE REAL WORLD, WOULD IT?

00:07:19.698 --> 00:07:21.325
Asuna: NO, IT WOULDN'T.

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:25.245
YOU CAN FEEL A LOT MORE
TOUCHING A REAL HAND.

00:07:25.287 --> 00:07:26.497
HEY, IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN

00:07:26.538 --> 00:07:28.082
BY THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE AMOUNT OF DATA?

00:07:28.123 --> 00:07:30.751
Kazuto: YUP. AND CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

00:07:30.793 --> 00:07:33.462
IF WE COULD REPRODUCE
THE FEEL OF SKIN AND A PULSE?

00:07:33.504 --> 00:07:35.005
WOULD WE BE ABLE
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE

00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:37.675
BETWEEN A REAL HAND
AND AN AVATAR'S HAND?

00:07:37.716 --> 00:07:41.011
Asuna: I KNOW I COULD
IF I WAS TOUCHING YOUR HAND.

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:44.264
BUT IT'S NOT JUST TOUCH, IS IT?

00:07:44.306 --> 00:07:46.517
I MEAN, IN THE REAL WORLD,
WE GET A LOT OF INFORMATION

00:07:46.558 --> 00:07:48.727
FROM HOW SOMETHING SOUNDS
OR TASTES.

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:51.772
EVEN IF OUR AMUSPHERE RIGS
COULD ACCESS AUGMENTED REALITY,

00:07:51.814 --> 00:07:53.357
WE'D STILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:56.610
Kazuto: YEAH. THE SECOND
YOU SAW OR TOUCHED SOMETHING,

00:07:56.652 --> 00:07:58.737
YOU'D KNOW
IF IT WAS REAL OR NOT.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.823
BUT HOPEFULLY
SOMEONE'LL COME ALONG

00:08:00.864 --> 00:08:03.117
AND MAKE
A TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH,

00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:04.743
AND WHATEVER THAT IS,
IT'LL HAVE TO OUTPUT

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:07.830
A TON OF SENSORY DATA
ALL THE TIME.

00:08:07.871 --> 00:08:09.623
Asuna: THEN WE COULD
BREAK DOWN THE WALL

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:12.000
BETWEEN BOTH WORLDS
AND BE WITH YUI FOREVER.

00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:14.294
DO YOU THINK THAT DAY
WILL EVER COME FOR US?

00:08:14.336 --> 00:08:15.921
Kazuto: YEAH.

00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:18.382
Asuna: THEN GET TO WORK
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN, 'KAY?

00:08:18.424 --> 00:08:19.591
Kazuto: OKAY.

00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:40.114
Waiter: WELCOME, SIR.

00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:43.909
Kikuoka: HEY, KIRITO!

00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:45.911
OVER HERE! (CHUCKLING)

00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:54.921
Kikuoka: GO AHEAD.
ORDER WHATEVER YOU WANT.

00:08:54.963 --> 00:08:56.548
IT'S ON ME.

00:08:57.789 --> 00:08:59.750
Kazuto: THANK YOU, SIR.
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.

00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:02.377
Kikuoka: COME ON. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SO FORMAL WITH ME.

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:04.880
RELAX, AND TALK TO ME
LIKE YOU WOULD IN A.L.O.

00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:07.132
Kazuto: OKAY. IF YOU SAY SO.

00:09:07.174 --> 00:09:09.760
THEN I GUESS I'LL...

00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:11.261
(GASPS)

00:09:12.512 --> 00:09:15.390
(GROANS)

00:09:15.432 --> 00:09:18.351
I'D LIKE
THE PARFAIT AU CHOCOLAT,

00:09:18.393 --> 00:09:20.604
THE FRAMBOISE MILLE‐FEUILLE,

00:09:20.645 --> 00:09:22.230
AND A HAZELNUT LATTE.

00:09:23.732 --> 00:09:24.816
‐ (SIGHS)
‐ Kikuoka: SORRY TO MAKE YOU

00:09:24.858 --> 00:09:26.526
COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE,
KIRITO.

00:09:26.568 --> 00:09:28.028
Kazuto: IF YOU'RE
THAT SORRY ABOUT IT,

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:29.946
WHY'D YOU ASK ME
TO COME TO GINZA?

00:09:29.988 --> 00:09:31.281
OH, AND DO YOU THINK

00:09:31.323 --> 00:09:33.784
YOU CAN NOT CALL ME
BY THAT NAME IN PUBLIC?

00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:35.577
Kikuoka: WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE ATTITUDE?

00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:37.746
I THOUGHT WE WERE BUDS.

00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:40.582
I WAS THE FIRST TO VISIT YOU
IN THE HOSPITAL, REMEMBER?

00:09:40.624 --> 00:09:42.250
Kazuto: (SIGHS)

00:09:42.292 --> 00:09:45.420
Kazuto: HE'S RIGHT.
WHEN I CAME TO,

00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:47.714
THE FIRST ONE THERE
WASN'T MY FAMILY.

00:09:47.756 --> 00:09:49.800
IT WAS THE LEADER
OF THE TASK FORCE,

00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:53.220
SEIJIROU KIKUOKA
FROM THE TECH BUREAU

00:09:53.261 --> 00:09:56.306
AT THE MINISTRY OF INTERNAL
AFFAIRS AND COMMUNICATIONS,

00:09:56.348 --> 00:10:00.227
A.K.A. THE VIRTUAL REALITY
SECTION.

00:10:00.268 --> 00:10:02.270
Kikuoka: (HUMMING)

00:10:03.647 --> 00:10:05.732
Kazuto: SO WHAT'D YOU
WANNA SEE ME ABOUT?

00:10:05.774 --> 00:10:07.400
IF IT'S ANYTHING
S.A.O. RELATED,

00:10:07.442 --> 00:10:09.653
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW.

00:10:09.694 --> 00:10:11.696
Kikuoka: ACTUALLY,
I WANNA TALK TO YOU

00:10:11.738 --> 00:10:14.074
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:15.617
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT.

00:10:17.077 --> 00:10:18.203
Kazuto: WHO'S HE?

00:10:18.245 --> 00:10:20.872
Kikuoka: THIS WON'T BE PLEASANT.

00:10:20.914 --> 00:10:23.708
SO LAST MONTH,
ON NOVEMBER THE 14TH...

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.753
THE LANDLORD OF AN APARTMENT
COMPLEX IN NAKANO, TOKYO,

00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:28.255
NOTICED A FOUL ODOR
WHILE CLEANING.

00:10:28.296 --> 00:10:30.549
IT WAS COMING
FROM ONE OF THE UNITS,

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.260
SO HE DISABLED THE LOCK
AND DISCOVERED THIS MAN DEAD.

00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:36.680
HIS NAME WAS TAMOTSU SHIGEMURA,
AND HE WAS 26.

00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:38.932
HE'D BEEN DEAD FOR FIVE DAYS.

00:10:38.974 --> 00:10:40.600
THEY FOUND HIM IN BED.

00:10:40.642 --> 00:10:42.853
HIS PLACE WAS A MESS,
BUT NO SIGNS OF BURGLARY.

00:10:42.894 --> 00:10:45.021
HE HAD SOMETHING INTERESTING
ON HIS HEAD, THOUGH.

00:10:45.063 --> 00:10:47.440
Kazuto: AN AMUSPHERE?

00:10:47.482 --> 00:10:50.235
Kikuoka: YEAH. IT WAS RULED
AN UNNATURAL DEATH,

00:10:50.277 --> 00:10:51.820
SO THEY DID AN AUTOPSY.

00:10:51.862 --> 00:10:55.156
THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS FOUND
TO BE ACUTE HEART FAILURE.

00:10:55.198 --> 00:10:56.950
Kazuto: WAIT. HEART FAILURE?

00:10:56.992 --> 00:10:58.785
YOU MEAN HIS HEART STOPPED?

00:10:58.827 --> 00:11:00.078
THEY FIND OUT WHY?

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.454
Kikuoka: NO, THEY DIDN'T.

00:11:03.123 --> 00:11:04.416
Waiter: HERE YOU ARE, SIR.

00:11:07.752 --> 00:11:10.255
Kikuoka: UNFORTUNATELY,
SINCE SO MUCH TIME HAD PASSED

00:11:10.297 --> 00:11:13.091
SINCE HIS DEATH AND FOUL PLAY
WAS RULED OUT AS THE CAUSE,

00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:15.135
THE AUTOPSY
WASN'T VERY THOROUGH.

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:17.554
WE DO KNOW HE'D BEEN LOGGED IN
FOR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT

00:11:17.596 --> 00:11:19.681
AND HADN'T EATEN ANYTHING
THE WHOLE TIME.

00:11:19.723 --> 00:11:22.267
Kazuto: WELL,
THAT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL.

00:11:22.309 --> 00:11:24.185
PLAYERS DO IT ALL THE TIME.

00:11:24.227 --> 00:11:25.979
WAIT. WHY ARE YOU TELLIN' ME
ABOUT THIS?

00:11:26.021 --> 00:11:27.814
Kikuoka: HE HAD A GAME
INSTALLED ON HIS SYSTEM

00:11:27.856 --> 00:11:30.483
CALLED "GUN GALE ONLINE."
YOU KNOW THAT ONE?

00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:32.193
Kazuto: YEAH. G.G.O.

00:11:32.235 --> 00:11:35.155
IT'S THE ONLY MMO IN JAPAN
WITH PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS.

00:11:35.196 --> 00:11:37.532
Kikuoka: THIS PAST OCTOBER,
THERE WAS A TOURNAMENT

00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:40.577
TO DECIDE THE MOST POWERFUL
PLAYER IN G.G.O.

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:42.871
THE DECEASED
WAS THE GUY WHO WON IT.

00:11:42.913 --> 00:11:45.081
HIS CHARACTER'S NAME WAS XEXEED.

00:11:45.123 --> 00:11:47.918
Kazuto: WAS HE PLAYING G.G.O.
WHEN HE DIED?

00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:50.545
Kikuoka: NO. WHEN IT HAPPENED,
HE WAS APPEARING

00:11:50.587 --> 00:11:54.424
ON A SHOW CALLED "MMO STREAM"
AS XEXEED'S AVATAR.

00:11:54.466 --> 00:11:56.593
WE KNOW THE TIME FROM THE LOGS.

00:11:56.635 --> 00:12:00.513
THIS NEXT BIT OF INFO
STILL NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED.

00:12:00.555 --> 00:12:02.307
ACCORDING TO
ANOTHER PLAYER'S BLOG,

00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:04.559
AT THE SAME TIME SHIGEMURA
HAD THE HEART ATTACK,

00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:06.937
SOMETHING STRANGE
HAPPENED IN G.G.O.

00:12:06.978 --> 00:12:08.271
Kazuto: WHAT?

00:12:08.313 --> 00:12:10.148
Kikuoka: SOME PLAYERS
WERE AT A BAR IN‐GAME

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.233
WATCHING THE SHOW, WHEN ONE
OF THE PLAYERS STOOD UP

00:12:12.275 --> 00:12:14.736
AND STARTED ACTING ERRATICALLY.

00:12:14.778 --> 00:12:17.197
THE BLOG STATES
THE PLAYER WAS SHOUTING STUFF

00:12:17.238 --> 00:12:20.241
ABOUT "JUDGMENT" AND "POWER"
AT XEXEED'S IMAGE ON THE TV

00:12:20.283 --> 00:12:21.785
AND THEN FIRED HIS GUN AT IT.

00:12:21.826 --> 00:12:24.245
AT THE TIME,
ANOTHER PLAYER IN THE BAR

00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:26.289
HAPPENED TO BE RECORDING AUDIO.

00:12:26.331 --> 00:12:28.875
HE UPLOADED IT TO A VIDEO SITE.

00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:33.129
SINCE THE FILE HAD A JAPAN
STANDARD TIME COUNTER EMBEDDED,

00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:36.341
WE KNOW THAT THE SHOT FIRED
AT THE TV AND SHIGEMURA'S AVATAR

00:12:36.383 --> 00:12:39.427
DISAPPEARING FROM THE SHOW
HAPPENED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME.

00:12:39.469 --> 00:12:41.972
Kazuto: PROBABLY
JUST COINCIDENCE.

00:12:42.013 --> 00:12:43.682
Kikuoka: THERE WAS
ANOTHER DEATH, THOUGH.

00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:44.891
Kazuto: WHAT?

00:12:44.933 --> 00:12:47.936
THIS ONE HAPPENED
ON NOVEMBER THE 28TH

00:12:47.978 --> 00:12:51.481
SOMEWHERE IN SAITAMA PREFECTURE,
SAME SETUP AS BEFORE.

00:12:51.523 --> 00:12:54.109
THE DECEASED WAS FOUND
IN THEIR APARTMENT.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.903
A GUY DELIVERING THE NEWSPAPER
HAPPENED TO LOOK IN THE WINDOW.

00:12:56.945 --> 00:12:59.698
HE SAW THE VICTIM LYING IN BED
WEARING AN AMUSPHERE RIG,

00:12:59.739 --> 00:13:00.907
SAID THE SMELL WAS...

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:03.410
‐ Woman: (COUGHING)
‐ Woman #2: AHEM!

00:13:03.451 --> 00:13:05.912
Kikuoka: LET'S SKIP THE DETAILS
OF THE CORPSE'S CONDITION.

00:13:05.954 --> 00:13:08.873
ANYWAY, HEART FAILURE
WAS THE CAUSE OF DEATH.

00:13:08.915 --> 00:13:11.835
THE VICTIM WAS ALSO
A TOP‐RANKING G.G.O. PLAYER.

00:13:11.876 --> 00:13:13.545
HIS CHARACTER'S NAME WAS...

00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:17.173
USUSHIO TARAKO? WELL,
HE WAS PLAYING WHEN HE DIED.

00:13:17.215 --> 00:13:20.051
IT HAPPENED IN THE CENTRAL PLAZA
IN GLOCKEN.

00:13:20.093 --> 00:13:23.513
HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF A MEETING WITH HIS "SQUAD."

00:13:23.555 --> 00:13:25.390
I GUESS THAT'S
THE SAME AS A GUILD.

00:13:26.433 --> 00:13:27.934
A STRANGE PLAYER WENT UP TO HIM

00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:29.352
AND SHOT HIM, POINT‐BLANK.

00:13:29.394 --> 00:13:30.979
Kazuto: DO YOU KNOW

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.773
IF IT WAS THE SAME GUY
WHO SHOT XEXEED?

00:13:33.815 --> 00:13:35.066
Kikuoka: MOST LIKELY.

00:13:35.108 --> 00:13:37.026
HE SAID STUFF
ABOUT JUDGMENT AND POWER

00:13:37.068 --> 00:13:39.821
AND THEN IDENTIFIED HIMSELF
WITH THE SAME CHARACTER NAME.

00:13:39.863 --> 00:13:40.864
Kazuto: WHAT NAME?

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:43.575
Kikuoka: DEATH GUN.

00:13:44.836 --> 00:13:46.254
Kazuto: DEATH...GUN?

00:13:52.886 --> 00:13:56.556
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE BOTH
VICTIMS DIED FROM HEART FAILURE?

00:13:56.598 --> 00:13:58.475
Kikuoka: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:13:58.516 --> 00:14:01.269
Kazuto: WAS THERE ANY DAMAGE
TO THEIR BRAINS?

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.606
Kikuoka: I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT THAT, TOO,

00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:07.192
SO I ASKED THE CORONER
IF HE FOUND ANY TRACE OF DAMAGE

00:14:07.233 --> 00:14:09.944
TO EITHER OF THEIR BRAINS,
AND HE SAID THEY WERE BOTH FINE.

00:14:09.986 --> 00:14:14.324
BESIDES, THE NERVEGEAR RIG
USED HIGH‐OUTPUT MICROWAVES

00:14:14.365 --> 00:14:16.284
POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO FRY THE SIGNAL ELEMENTS

00:14:16.326 --> 00:14:17.952
AND DESTROY THE BRAIN.

00:14:17.994 --> 00:14:20.121
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THE AMUSPHERE RIG WAS DESIGNED

00:14:20.163 --> 00:14:21.289
SO THAT IT COULDN'T EMIT

00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:23.041
ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
THAT POWERFUL.

00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:25.085
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT
THE DEVELOPERS CLAIM.

00:14:25.126 --> 00:14:28.254
Kazuto: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS
HAVE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK,

00:14:28.296 --> 00:14:30.340
BUT EVEN SO, YOUR STORY'S

00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:32.008
BUILT AROUND COINCIDENCE
AND RUMORS.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.886
Kikuoka: TRUE. IT COULD BE
A COINCIDENCE OR EVEN A HOAX.

00:14:34.928 --> 00:14:36.262
I'M NOT SOLD EITHER WAY.

00:14:36.304 --> 00:14:39.265
FOR NOW‐‐AND THIS IS
HYPOTHETICAL, MIND YOU‐‐

00:14:39.307 --> 00:14:41.601
DO YOU THINK IT'S EVEN
REMOTELY POSSIBLE

00:14:41.643 --> 00:14:43.603
TO STOP A PLAYER'S HEART
IN THE REAL WORLD

00:14:43.645 --> 00:14:46.189
WITH VIRTUAL BULLETS
FROM A VIRTUAL GUN?

00:15:01.579 --> 00:15:03.164
Kazuto: (GASPS)

00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:07.168
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.963
BUT HYPOTHETICALLY
LET'S SAY THIS DEATH GUN

00:15:10.004 --> 00:15:12.340
DID SEND SOME KIND
OF KILLER SIGNAL TO XEXEED

00:15:12.382 --> 00:15:14.759
AND THAT TARAKO GUY'S
AMUSPHERES.

00:15:14.801 --> 00:15:16.136
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

00:15:16.177 --> 00:15:19.180
COULD THE SENSATION OF A TOUCH
STOP A HEART?

00:15:19.222 --> 00:15:21.641
MAYBE A TASTE OR SMELL,

00:15:21.683 --> 00:15:23.017
A SIGHT, A SOUND,

00:15:23.059 --> 00:15:25.562
OR SOME OTHER SENSATION.

00:15:25.603 --> 00:15:27.313
‐ Kikuoka: (CHUCKLES)
‐ Kazuto: HUH?

00:15:27.355 --> 00:15:31.234
OKAY, WHOA. YOU ALREADY THOUGHT
OF THIS, HAVEN'T YOU?

00:15:31.276 --> 00:15:34.571
OH, I GET IT, YOU AND YOUR TEAM
CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT,

00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:37.198
SO YOU INVITE ME FOR COFFEE
TO PICK MY BRAIN?

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.825
Kikuoka: NO!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:15:38.867 --> 00:15:40.994
I‐I'D NEVER DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT TO YOU, HONEST.

00:15:41.035 --> 00:15:43.955
I LIKE TALKING TO YOU
AND JUST WANTED YOUR OPINION.

00:15:43.997 --> 00:15:44.956
Kazuto: WE'RE DONE.

00:15:44.998 --> 00:15:47.333
YOU WANT MY OPINION, HERE IT IS.

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:48.793
YOU CAN'T STOP A PLAYER'S HEART

00:15:48.835 --> 00:15:51.087
IN THE REAL WORLD
BY ACTIONS IN‐GAME.

00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:52.922
SHOTS FIRED AND THE HEART
ATTACKS ARE COINCIDENCES.

00:15:52.964 --> 00:15:54.132
Kikuoka: WAIT! HOLD ON!

00:15:54.174 --> 00:15:55.550
LISTEN, YOU CAN ORDER
SOMETHING ELSE!

00:15:55.592 --> 00:15:57.385
JUST SIT DOWN,
AND HANG OUT FOR A BIT.

00:15:57.427 --> 00:15:59.137
PLEASE.

00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:01.472
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW RELIEVED I AM

00:16:01.514 --> 00:16:02.974
TO HEAR YOU PUT IT INTO WORDS.

00:16:03.016 --> 00:16:05.643
FACT IS,
I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU.

00:16:05.685 --> 00:16:07.270
I DON'T BELIEVE THESE TWO DEATHS

00:16:07.312 --> 00:16:10.148
WERE CAUSED
BY IN‐GAME GUNSHOTS EITHER.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.026
AND NOW THAT WE'VE TALKED,
I WANT TO ASK YOU OFFICIALLY.

00:16:13.067 --> 00:16:16.237
WOULD YOU LOG IN TO "GUN GALE
ONLINE" AND MAKE CONTACT

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:19.032
WITH THE PLAYER
CALLING HIMSELF DEATH GUN?

00:16:19.073 --> 00:16:21.993
Kazuto: AND ONCE I DO
FIND THE GUY, THEN WHAT?

00:16:22.035 --> 00:16:23.870
YOU WANT ME TO GET SHOT?
IS THAT IT?

00:16:23.912 --> 00:16:25.997
‐ Kikuoka: WHOA, NOW. COME ON.
‐ Kazuto: WELL, SCREW THAT!

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:28.333
‐ I DON'T WANNA GET KILLED!
‐ (CUPS RATTLE)

00:16:28.374 --> 00:16:29.918
Kikuoka: THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:32.086
WE JUST AGREED IT WASN'T,
DIDN'T WE?!

00:16:32.128 --> 00:16:33.838
BESIDES, THIS DEATH GUN GUY

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.632
IS ONLY GOING
AFTER SPECIFIC TARGETS!

00:16:35.673 --> 00:16:37.175
THEY HAVE TO MEET HIS CRITERIA!

00:16:37.217 --> 00:16:39.302
‐ Kazuto: CRITERIA?
‐ Kikuoka: UH‐HUH!

00:16:40.345 --> 00:16:41.304
HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:16:41.346 --> 00:16:43.223
XEXEED AND USUSHIO TARAKO

00:16:43.264 --> 00:16:46.100
WEREN'T JUST ANY OLD PLAYERS.
THEY WERE TOP RANKED,

00:16:46.142 --> 00:16:49.062
SO IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
HE'S NOT INTERESTED IN NEWBIES.

00:16:49.103 --> 00:16:50.271
BUT IF YOU WERE STRONG ENOUGH

00:16:50.313 --> 00:16:51.898
TO BEAT KAYABA
AT HIS OWN GAME, THEN‐‐

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.274
Kazuto: THAT'S DIFFERENT!

00:16:53.316 --> 00:16:54.609
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE HEARD,

00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:56.152
BUT G.G.O.
IS NO WALK IN THE PARK!

00:16:56.194 --> 00:16:57.237
IT'S FILLED WITH PRO GAMERS!

00:16:57.278 --> 00:16:58.738
Kikuoka: HOLD THE PHONE!

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.115
YOU SAID, "PRO GAMER."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, "PRO"?

00:17:01.157 --> 00:17:03.785
Kazuto: IT MEANS PROFESSIONAL,
LITERALLY.

00:17:03.826 --> 00:17:05.787
"GUN GALE ONLINE"
IS THE ONLY VIRTUAL MMO

00:17:05.828 --> 00:17:08.164
WITH A GAME‐COIN
TO REAL‐CURRENCY

00:17:08.206 --> 00:17:10.875
‐ CONVERSION SYSTEM IN PLACE.
‐ Kikuoka: WHAT?

00:17:10.917 --> 00:17:12.835
Kazuto: IT MEANS WHATEVER MONEY
YOU EARN IN THE GAME

00:17:12.877 --> 00:17:15.838
GETS PAID BACK TO YOU IN COLD,
HARD CASH IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.841
BEIN' A PRO MEANS YOU HAVE
A CONSTANT STREAM OF INCOME

00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:20.969
FROM THE GAME
COMIN' IN EVERY MONTH,

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.054
AND IF YOU'RE A TOP PLAYER,
THAT MEANS MONTHLY

00:17:23.096 --> 00:17:24.847
YOU'RE MAKING
TWO TO THREE HUNDRED THOU.

00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:27.517
IT'S AN AWESOME GIG.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:30.979
THAT'S WHY THE HIGH‐LEVEL GUYS
IN G.G.O. ARE SO HARDCORE.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.814
THEY POUR MORE TIME
AND PASSION INTO IT

00:17:32.855 --> 00:17:35.233
THAN PLAYERS FROM OTHER MMOS.

00:17:35.275 --> 00:17:37.235
SOMEONE LIKE ME
CAN'T JUST LOG IN

00:17:37.277 --> 00:17:39.779
AND MATCH PLAYERS LIKE THAT.
YOU SHOULD FIND SOMEONE ELSE‐‐

00:17:39.821 --> 00:17:41.239
Kikuoka: WHOA,
HOLD IT! HOLD IT!

00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:42.740
WHO ELSE AM I GONNA FIND?
YOU'RE IT!

00:17:42.782 --> 00:17:44.909
I NEED YOUR HELP
IN THIS INVESTIGATION,

00:17:44.951 --> 00:17:47.745
AND IF TAKING THESE PROS ON
IS GOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL,

00:17:47.787 --> 00:17:49.706
I CAN PAY YOU THIS MUCH.

00:17:49.747 --> 00:17:51.708
Kazuto: (GULPS)

00:17:51.749 --> 00:17:53.751
I DON'T GET WHY
YOU'RE SO HUNG UP ON THIS.

00:17:53.793 --> 00:17:56.421
YOU FIND HORROR STORIES
LIKE THESE ALL THE TIME ONLINE.

00:17:57.547 --> 00:17:58.840
Kikuoka: YEAH, I KNOW.

00:17:58.881 --> 00:18:00.633
BUT STILL, IT'S GOT
MY BOSSES WORRIED.

00:18:00.675 --> 00:18:04.137
THE EFFECT OF FULL‐DIVE
TECHNOLOGY ON THE REAL WORLD

00:18:04.178 --> 00:18:05.430
IS THE HOTTEST TOPIC TODAY.

00:18:05.471 --> 00:18:08.057
LITERALLY EVERYONE'S
RESEARCHING IT.

00:18:08.099 --> 00:18:10.268
Kikuoka: PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO TRY TO USE THESE DEATHS

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.894
TO REGULATE THE TECHNOLOGY.

00:18:11.936 --> 00:18:14.147
WE WANT TO KNOW THE FACTS
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

00:18:14.188 --> 00:18:16.274
WE WANT TO BE SURE.

00:18:16.316 --> 00:18:18.735
THAT'S WHY WE'RE INTERESTED.

00:18:18.776 --> 00:18:21.321
Kazuto: YOU GUYS COULD JUST GO
DIRECTLY TO THE ADMINS ABOUT IT.

00:18:21.362 --> 00:18:23.448
Kikuoka: RIGHT, BUT ZASKAR,

00:18:23.489 --> 00:18:26.826
THE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPED
AND HOSTS G.G.O., IS IN THE U. S.

00:18:26.868 --> 00:18:29.287
THEIR ADDRESS,
PHONE NUMBER, AND EMAIL,

00:18:29.329 --> 00:18:32.832
NONE OF IT'S BEEN MADE PUBLIC,
SO WE CAN'T CONTACT THEM.

00:18:32.874 --> 00:18:35.043
EVER SINCE THE SEED
WAS RELEASED,

00:18:35.084 --> 00:18:37.587
ALL KINDS OF SHADY VR WORLDS
HAVE POPPED UP.

00:18:37.629 --> 00:18:39.088
Kazuto: YEAH.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.757
Kikuoka: MAYBE THEY'RE LEGIT,

00:18:40.798 --> 00:18:43.217
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT, BUT IF WE
WANT TO FIND ANYTHING OUT,

00:18:43.259 --> 00:18:46.471
THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO TRY
CONTACTING THEM IN THE GAME.

00:18:46.512 --> 00:18:48.306
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO GET SHOT.

00:18:48.348 --> 00:18:51.059
WE'LL TAKE WHATEVER
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WE HAVE TO.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.062
JUST EVALUATE THE SITUATION,
AND REPORT BACK.

00:18:54.103 --> 00:18:55.897
SO WILL YOU HELP US, OR WHAT?

00:18:59.942 --> 00:19:01.110
Kazuto: FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE...

00:19:01.152 --> 00:19:03.655
DIED IN AINCRAD.

00:19:03.696 --> 00:19:05.073
IT'S BEEN A YEAR,

00:19:05.114 --> 00:19:08.159
AND FINALLY THOSE MEMORIES
ARE STARTING TO FADE.

00:19:08.201 --> 00:19:13.581
BUT NOW MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING
IN ANOTHER VIRTUAL WORLD,

00:19:13.623 --> 00:19:15.583
AND I'M GETTING PULLED BACK IN.

00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:19.420
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE
DOESN'T WANT ME TO EVER FORGET.

00:19:23.466 --> 00:19:27.053
Asuna: OHH. NOW I GET IT.

00:19:27.095 --> 00:19:30.181
I THINK I FIGURED OUT
WHY YOU BROUGHT ME HERE TODAY.

00:19:30.223 --> 00:19:31.641
Kazuto: OH. YOU DID, HUH?

00:19:31.683 --> 00:19:33.017
Asuna: MM‐HMM.

00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:36.270
IF OUR WORLD IS MADE UP
OF AN AXIS CALLED TIME

00:19:36.312 --> 00:19:39.273
AND A PLANE CALLED SPACE,
THEN THE CENTER OF OUR REALITY

00:19:39.315 --> 00:19:42.151
IS THIS PLACE
IN THE HEART OF TOKYO

00:19:42.193 --> 00:19:43.986
WHERE A CASTLE USED TO STAND.

00:19:44.028 --> 00:19:47.490
AND THE AXIS OF ALL THE VIRTUAL
WORLDS POPPING UP NOW,

00:19:47.532 --> 00:19:50.576
THANKS TO THE SEED, IS A PLACE
THAT ALSO HAD A CASTLE ONCE,

00:19:50.618 --> 00:19:52.120
AINCRAD.

00:19:52.161 --> 00:19:55.415
THAT'S WHY THIS SUNSET
FEELS SO NOSTALGIC NOW.

00:19:56.666 --> 00:20:00.128
Kazuto: YOU'RE RIGHT. IT DOES.

00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:01.629
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU JUST SAID

00:20:01.671 --> 00:20:03.131
HELPED ME FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, TOO.

00:20:03.172 --> 00:20:04.507
Asuna: HUH? REALLY?

00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:06.634
Kazuto: YOU REMEMBER
WHAT AINCRAD LOOKED LIKE?

00:20:06.676 --> 00:20:09.637
WELL, MAYBE ITS SHAPE
WAS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:12.724
THE AXIS OF TIME
AND THE PLANE OF SPACE.

00:20:12.765 --> 00:20:16.102
Asuna: MAYBE, BUT IF ITS
VERTICAL AXIS REPRESENTED TIME

00:20:16.144 --> 00:20:17.979
AND ITS FLOORS SPACE,

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.273
THEN THE COMMANDER MADE A WORLD
THAT TAPERED TO NOTHING.

00:20:20.314 --> 00:20:21.941
EVERYTHING ENDED
ONCE YOU REACHED THE TOP.

00:20:21.983 --> 00:20:26.195
UNFORTUNATELY, A CERTAIN SOMEONE
DESTROYED IT HALFWAY UP.

00:20:26.237 --> 00:20:27.905
NOW WE'LL NEVER KNOW
HOW IT ENDED.

00:20:27.947 --> 00:20:30.616
Kazuto: YES, MA'AM!
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MA'AM!

00:20:30.658 --> 00:20:34.579
Both: (LAUGHING)

00:20:37.331 --> 00:20:39.459
Kazuto: ASUNA, LISTEN. I‐‐

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.626
Asuna: WHAT?

00:20:42.378 --> 00:20:44.547
Kazuto: NAH.
HEY, IT'S GETTIN' COLD.

00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:45.798
YOU WANNA
START HEADIN' BACK NOW?

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.675
Asuna: MM‐HMM.
OH, AND NEXT TIME WE COME,

00:20:47.717 --> 00:20:49.469
LET'S BRING LIZ AND LEAFA
AND THE OTHERS.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.803
WOULDN'T IT BE FUN

00:20:50.845 --> 00:20:52.764
TO GET EVERYONE TOGETHER
FOR A PICNIC HERE?

00:20:52.805 --> 00:20:55.767
Kazuto: YEAH, IT WOULD,
ESPECIALLY IN SPRINGTIME.

00:21:10.531 --> 00:21:11.491
Man: I'M IN POSITION.

00:21:11.532 --> 00:21:13.075
Woman: ROGER.

00:21:13.117 --> 00:21:16.162
TARGETS HAVEN'T CHANGED
THEIR COURSE OR THEIR SPEED.

00:21:16.204 --> 00:21:17.830
THEY'RE FOUR HUNDRED METERS
FROM YOU,

00:21:17.872 --> 00:21:19.582
FIFTEEN HUNDRED FROM ME.

00:21:19.624 --> 00:21:22.126
Man: PRETTY FAR.
CAN YOU MAKE THE SHOT?

00:21:22.168 --> 00:21:23.461
Woman: NO SWEAT.

00:21:23.503 --> 00:21:25.546
Man: OKAY, THEN.
FIRE WHEN READY.

00:21:25.588 --> 00:21:27.840
‐ I'M COUNTING ON YOU, SINON.
‐ Sinon: ROGER.

00:21:32.762 --> 00:21:34.263
THIS PRESSURE...

00:21:34.305 --> 00:21:36.390
THIS ANXIETY...

00:21:36.432 --> 00:21:37.600
THIS FEAR.

00:21:38.601 --> 00:21:40.144
FIFTEEN HUNDRED METERS?

00:21:40.186 --> 00:21:41.646
THAT'S NOTHING,

00:21:41.687 --> 00:21:44.315
LIKE TOSSING A WAD OF PAPER
INTO A TRASH CAN.

00:21:45.817 --> 00:21:47.735
NO WAY.

00:21:47.777 --> 00:21:50.446
THIS IS NOTHING
LIKE HOW IT FELT THAT DAY.

00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:04.085
NEXT.
