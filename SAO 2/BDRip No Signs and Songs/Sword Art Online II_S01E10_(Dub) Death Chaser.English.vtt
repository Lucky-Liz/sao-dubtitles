WHY?

00:00:18.983 --> 00:00:20.818
WHY HERE?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.571

TO BE BRAVE...

00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:42.461

LEARN THOSE THINGS FROM KIRITO.

WITH ALL THIS SHAKING AROUND,
I CAN'T LOCK ON.

GONNA STOP IN THREE,

NO, IT'S NOT
THAT HE'S BEING CALM.

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:23.469
HE'S GIVING IT
EVERYTHING HE'S GOT.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.805
WHEN HE FIGHTS,
HE GOES ALL OUT EVERY TIME,

HE GETS HIS STRENGTH.

00:08:42.738 --> 00:08:44.198

OUT HERE.

00:09:27.742 --> 00:09:29.744
WE NEED TO FIND SOME COVER.

I SEE A CAVE OVER THERE.

00:09:37.503 --> 00:09:40.923
IF WE HIDE INSIDE,
WE CAN AVOID THE SAT SCAN.

WE CAN DODGE THE SCAN
AND REST UP, TOO.

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:13.247
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?

00:10:13.288 --> 00:10:16.208
IT'S LIKE HE JUST POPPED UP
OUT OF NOWHERE.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.710
WE DIDN'T SEE HIM ON THE SCAN.

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:22.047
THAT MUST MEAN HE'S GOT
SOME KIND OF CLOAKING SKILL.

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:24.925
IS THERE A SKILL LIKE THAT HERE,
INVISIBILITY?

00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:28.512
Sinon: YEAH, THERE IS.
IT'S A SKILL

00:10:28.554 --> 00:10:30.931

OPTICAL CAMOUFLAGE.

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:36.770
WE'RE SAFE, FOR NOW ANYWAY.

00:10:36.812 --> 00:10:38.647
EVEN IF HE'S INVISIBLE,

00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:40.691
THE SANDS ARE ROUGH HERE.

00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:42.651
WE'LL HEAR IT CRUNCHING
UNDER HIS BOOTS.

00:10:42.693 --> 00:10:44.319
WE'LL SEE
HIS FOOTPRINTS, TOO,

00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:47.656
SO HE CAN'T SNEAK UP
LIKE HE DID BEFORE.

00:10:47.698 --> 00:10:49.199
Kirito: ROGER THAT.

00:10:49.241 --> 00:10:52.744
WELL, I GUESS WE'LL KEEP
OUR EYES AND EARS OPEN.

00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:59.960
Sinon: HEY, KIRITO,

00:11:00.002 --> 00:11:01.879
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.089
DEATH GUN WAS KILLED
IN THAT EXPLOSION?

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:05.257
Kirito: NO.

00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:07.509
THE SECOND
BEFORE THAT TRUCK BLEW UP,

00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:10.679
I SAW HIM JUMP
OFF OF THAT ROBOT HORSE.

00:11:10.721 --> 00:11:13.182
HE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN DINGED UP,

00:11:13.223 --> 00:11:15.976
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT BLAST KILLED HIM.

00:11:16.018 --> 00:11:17.144
Sinon: OH.

00:11:19.396 --> 00:11:22.399
WHEN HE HAD ME IN HIS SIGHTS
BACK AT THE STADIUM,

00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:23.775
I THOUGHT I WAS A GONER.

00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:25.444
HOW'D YOU KNOW I WAS IN TROUBLE?

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:28.155
AND HOW'D YOU GET TO ME
SO FAST FROM YOUR POSITION?

00:11:28.197 --> 00:11:29.656
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

00:11:29.698 --> 00:11:32.284
WE WERE WRONG
ABOUT JUSHI X BEING DEATH GUN.

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:35.204
I TOOK ONE LOOK,
AND I KNEW IT WASN'T.

00:11:35.245 --> 00:11:36.788
IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS, ACTUALLY.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.123
Sinon: OBVIOUS?

00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:40.542
Kirito: YEAH. I KNOW
A WOMAN WHEN I SEE ONE.

00:11:40.584 --> 00:11:42.169
Sinon: OH.

00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:43.837
Kirito: THE SECOND I SAW HER,

00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:45.505
I KNEW WE OVERLOOKED SOMETHING.

00:11:45.547 --> 00:11:47.174
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT, THOUGH.

00:11:47.216 --> 00:11:48.884
OH, BY THE WAY,

00:11:48.926 --> 00:11:51.094
EVEN THOUGH
HER HANDLE SAYS JUSHI,

00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:53.722
SHE CALLS HERSELF MUSKETEER X.

00:11:53.764 --> 00:11:56.683
ANYWAY, AFTER I TOOK OUT
MUSKETEER X,

00:11:56.725 --> 00:11:58.393
I LOOKED OVER TO THE SOUTH

00:11:58.435 --> 00:12:00.687
AND SAW YOU LYING THERE
IN THE STREET.

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:03.315
I KNEW YOU WERE IN TROUBLE,

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:06.109
SO I GRABBED HER RIFLE
AND GRENADES AND CHARGED IN,

00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:09.529
SHOOTING AND TOSSING BOMBS
AS FAST AS I COULD.

00:12:15.785 --> 00:12:19.205
Sinon: I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LET MY GUARD DOWN LIKE THAT.

00:12:20.623 --> 00:12:23.293
Kirito: DON'T GO
BEATING YOURSELF UP OVER IT.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.756
I MEAN, LOOK,
IT'S NOT LIKE I KNEW

00:12:27.797 --> 00:12:29.340
HE WAS HIDING DOWN THERE EITHER,

00:12:29.382 --> 00:12:32.302
AND IF OUR ROLES WERE FLIPPED,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:12:32.343 --> 00:12:35.263
I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE
GETTING SHOT INSTEAD.

00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:37.098
BUT THAT'S OKAY, 'CAUSE I KNOW

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.642
YOU WOULD HAVE RESCUED ME,
TOO, WOULDN'T YOU?

00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:42.896
Sinon: (THINKING)
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:12:42.937 --> 00:12:46.274
MY RIVAL'S TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:50.779
HE KNOWS I'M WEAK,
AND HERE HE IS CONSOLING ME,

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.114
LIKE I'M A KID OR SOMETHING.

00:12:54.324 --> 00:12:56.367
Kirito: I'M HEADING OUT
FOR A BIT.

00:12:56.409 --> 00:13:00.038
YOU MIGHT AS WELL KICK BACK HERE
AND REST UP WHILE YOU CAN.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.707
I WISH YOU COULD LOG OUT,
BUT I KNOW YOU CAN'T,

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:04.793
NOT TILL THE TOURNEY'S OVER,
ANYWAY.

00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:05.835
Sinon: HUH?

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:12.133
YOU'RE GOING AFTER DEATH GUN,
AREN'T YOU?

00:13:12.175 --> 00:13:14.761
YOU THINK YOU CAN
TAKE HIM ON ALONE?

00:13:14.803 --> 00:13:17.722
Kirito: YEAH. I HAVE TO.

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:19.849
HE'S TOUGH, AND HE WON'T GO DOWN

00:13:19.891 --> 00:13:22.852
WITHOUT GETTING OFF
A SHOT OR TWO AT ME.

00:13:22.894 --> 00:13:26.272
IF IT COMES DOWN TO THAT,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO.

00:13:26.314 --> 00:13:28.233
I MIGHT BAIL.

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:30.360
I DON'T WANNA LEAVE YOU
HANGING LIKE THAT,

00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:32.445
SO IT'S BETTER
IF I FACE HIM ALONE.

00:13:32.487 --> 00:13:36.199
Sinon: THEN YOU'RE
SCARED OF HIM, TOO?

00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:38.368
Kirito: YEAH, I AM.

00:13:38.409 --> 00:13:39.953
IF IT WAS THE OLD ME,

00:13:39.994 --> 00:13:42.413
I WOULD HAVE JUMPED RIGHT IN
AND FOUGHT HIM,

00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:45.124
EVEN IF THERE WAS A CHANCE
I WAS GONNA DIE,

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:46.501
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

00:13:46.543 --> 00:13:49.504
THESE DAYS, THERE'S THINGS
I HAVE TO PROTECT.

00:13:49.546 --> 00:13:51.130
I CAN'T DIE.

00:13:51.172 --> 00:13:52.549
I DON'T WANT TO.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.551
Sinon: THINGS YOU
HAVE TO PROTECT?

00:13:54.592 --> 00:13:57.303
Kirito: YEAH,
IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD

00:13:57.345 --> 00:13:58.472
AND THE REAL ONE, TOO.

00:13:59.013 --> 00:14:00.065
Sinon: OKAY.

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:01.725
THEN DON'T GO AFTER HIM.

00:14:01.767 --> 00:14:03.518
JUST STAY HERE, AND KEEP LOW.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.439
AS LONG AS B.o.B.'S GOING ON,
WE CAN'T LOG OUT,

00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:08.774
BUT ONCE THE COMPETITION'S

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:11.318
WHITTLED DOWN TO US
AND ONE OTHER PLAYER,

00:14:11.359 --> 00:14:14.321
WE CAN SUICIDE OUT
AND LET THE OTHER GUY WIN.

00:14:14.362 --> 00:14:15.572
THAT'LL END THE TOURNAMENT.

00:14:15.614 --> 00:14:17.240
Kirito: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

00:14:17.282 --> 00:14:19.910
I MEAN,
THAT'S ONE WAY OF DOING IT.

00:14:19.951 --> 00:14:22.579
THING IS, IT'S NOT REALLY
A GOOD OPTION.

00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:25.540
IF WE JUST SIT HERE
AND WAIT FOR THE TOURNEY TO END,

00:14:25.582 --> 00:14:26.958
THERE'S NO TELLING

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.086
HOW MANY OTHER PLAYERS
THAT GUY'S GONNA KILL.

00:14:30.587 --> 00:14:31.588
Sinon: YEAH.

00:14:33.632 --> 00:14:37.511
(THINKING) YOU REALLY
ARE STRONG AFTER ALL.

00:14:40.806 --> 00:14:42.516
I'M NOT GONNA HIDE EITHER.

00:14:42.557 --> 00:14:44.434
Kirito: HUH?

00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:45.769
Sinon: I'M GOING OUTSIDE

00:14:45.811 --> 00:14:48.105
AND HELP YOU
TAKE THAT BASTARD OUT.

00:14:48.146 --> 00:14:50.398
Kirito: NO, YOU'RE NOT.
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN LISTENING?

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.984
IF HE SHOOTS YOU,
THERE'S A CHANCE YOU'LL DIE.

00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:55.070
AS A PLAYER,
CLOSE COMBAT'S MY SPECIALTY.

00:14:55.112 --> 00:14:56.279
IT'S NOT YOURS.

00:14:56.321 --> 00:14:58.323
YOU'RE IN WAY MORE DANGER
THAN ME,

00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:00.117
'CAUSE HE CAN BE
INVISIBLE IF HE WANTS.

00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:02.786
HE'LL POP UP NEXT TO YOU,
AND BANG.

00:15:02.828 --> 00:15:05.080
Sinon: I DON'T CARE IF I DIE.

00:15:05.122 --> 00:15:06.373
Kirito: (GASPS)

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:08.708
Sinon: I WAS SCARED
OUT OF MY MIND

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.001
BACK AT THE STADIUM.

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.337
I WAS SCARED I WAS GONNA DIE.

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:15.382
I WAS EVEN WEAKER
THAN I WAS FIVE YEARS AGO,

00:15:15.423 --> 00:15:18.135
LIKE A SCREAMING,
CRYING LITTLE GIRL.

00:15:18.176 --> 00:15:22.139
IF THAT'S HOW I'M GONNA BE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.473
I'D RATHER BE DEAD.

00:15:23.515 --> 00:15:25.476
Kirito: IT'S ONLY NATURAL
TO BE AFRAID.

00:15:25.817 --> 00:15:28.779
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF DYING.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.948
Sinon: YEAH, WELL, I HATE IT.

00:15:30.989 --> 00:15:33.408
I'M TIRED OF BEING AFRAID.

00:15:34.826 --> 00:15:36.578
I'M SO TIRED.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.704
WHATEVER.

00:15:37.746 --> 00:15:40.040
I'M NOT ASKING TO GO WITH YOU.

00:15:40.082 --> 00:15:41.875
I'LL FIGHT BY MYSELF.

00:15:43.627 --> 00:15:46.672
Kirito: YOU WANT TO FIGHT ALONE
AND DIE ALONE.

00:15:46.713 --> 00:15:48.048
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.883
Sinon: YEAH.

00:15:49.925 --> 00:15:52.844
I WAS ALWAYS
SUPPOSED TO DIE ALONE.

00:15:52.886 --> 00:15:54.930
(GRUNTS) LET GO.

00:15:54.972 --> 00:15:56.598
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.267
Kirito: YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.

00:15:59.309 --> 00:16:00.852
THERE'S NO DYING ALONE.

00:16:00.894 --> 00:16:02.479
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:04.731
WHEN YOU DIE, YOU LEAVE A HOLE

00:16:04.773 --> 00:16:07.109
IN ALL THE PEOPLE
WHOSE LIVES YOU WERE PART OF,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.903
AND LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU'RE PART OF MINE NOW.

00:16:09.945 --> 00:16:13.198
Sinon: YEAH, WELL, I NEVER
ASKED TO BE A PART OF IT.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.201
BESIDES, MY LIFE'S
NO ONE ELSE'S BUSINESS BUT MINE.

00:16:16.243 --> 00:16:17.661
Kirito: YOU'RE WRONG.

00:16:17.703 --> 00:16:19.705
WE'RE INVOLVED
IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES NOW.

00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:21.915
Sinon: (GASPS)

00:16:21.957 --> 00:16:23.709
ALL RIGHT!

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.127
IF THAT'S HOW IT IS,

00:16:25.168 --> 00:16:27.212
THEN YOU CAN PROTECT ME
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

00:16:29.715 --> 00:16:31.717
(CRYING)

00:16:34.477 --> 00:16:36.980
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,

00:16:37.022 --> 00:16:38.648
AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING,

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.276
SO DON'T GO SAYING
STUFF LIKE THAT!

00:16:41.318 --> 00:16:44.571
THIS‐‐THIS ISN'T YOUR FIGHT!
IT'S MINE!

00:16:44.612 --> 00:16:46.865
MINE! YOU GOT THAT?!

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:50.118
EVEN IF I LOSE, EVEN IF I DIE,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.872
NO ONE CAN BLAME ME
FOR WHAT I DID.

00:16:53.913 --> 00:16:55.665
YOU WANT TO HELP?

00:16:55.707 --> 00:16:58.084
YOU GONNA CARRY
THIS BURDEN WITH ME?

00:16:58.126 --> 00:16:59.961
THEN WHAT, HUH?

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.925
YOU GONNA HOLD MY HANDS

00:17:05.967 --> 00:17:08.720
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE
GOT BLOOD ALL OVER 'EM?!

00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:13.433
Children: MURDERER.

00:17:13.475 --> 00:17:16.436
MURDERER. MURDERER.

00:17:16.478 --> 00:17:18.229
MURDERER.

00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:19.564
Boy: MURDERER.

00:17:19.606 --> 00:17:20.690
Girl: YOU MURDERER!

00:17:20.732 --> 00:17:22.317
Second boy:
YOU KILL ANYONE TODAY?

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.569
First boy:
EWW. DON'T TOUCH ME.

00:17:24.611 --> 00:17:26.571
YOU'LL GET ME ALL BLOODY.

00:17:26.613 --> 00:17:28.657
Girl: WHY DON'T YOU
KILL YOURSELF?

00:17:28.698 --> 00:17:29.991
Second boy: NYAH, NYAH!

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:31.534
First boy: PSYCHO!

00:17:31.576 --> 00:17:33.578
(TAUNTING FADES)

00:17:37.582 --> 00:17:39.417
Sinon: (CRYING)

00:17:59.104 --> 00:18:00.230
I HATE YOU!

00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:01.981
I HATE YOUR GUTS!

00:18:02.023 --> 00:18:03.525
I HATE YOU.

00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:06.569
(CONTINUES CRYING)

00:18:11.533 --> 00:18:13.535
(WIND BLOWING)

00:18:22.945 --> 00:18:25.615
EVEN THOUGH I HATE YOUR GUTS,

00:18:25.656 --> 00:18:29.490
CAN I BORROW YOUR LAP FOR A SEC?

00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:37.417
I...

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:42.546
I KILLED SOMEONE.

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:45.383
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO,

00:18:45.407 --> 00:18:47.367
IN A SMALL TOWN UP NORTH,

00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:50.054
THIS GUY TRIED TO ROB
A POST OFFICE.

00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:53.016
THE NEWS SAID THE ROBBER DIED

00:18:53.057 --> 00:18:55.768
'CAUSE HIS GUN
WENT OFF ACCIDENTALLY.

00:18:56.811 --> 00:18:59.731
BUT THE TRUTH IS I WAS THERE.

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:03.234
I GRABBED HIS GUN
AND SHOT HIM DEAD.

00:19:03.276 --> 00:19:05.528
Kirito: HOW OLD WERE YOU?

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.988
Sinon: 11 YEARS OLD.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.991
AND EVER SINCE THEN,
WHENEVER I SEE A GUN,

00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:12.911
I START THROWING UP,
AND THEN I PASS OUT.

00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:16.998
IF I SEE A GUN,
I SEE THE FACE OF THE ROBBER

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.585
THE WAY HE LOOKED
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:23.296
AND THEN I‐‐I GET SO SCARED.

00:19:23.338 --> 00:19:24.422
Kirito: REALLY?

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:26.883
Sinon: YEAH, BUT IN THIS WORLD,

00:19:26.925 --> 00:19:29.052
I DON'T HAVE THOSE PROBLEMS,

00:19:29.093 --> 00:19:31.387
AND THAT GOT ME THINKING.

00:19:31.429 --> 00:19:34.891
IF I CAN BECOME THE STRONGEST
PLAYER IN THE GAME,

00:19:34.933 --> 00:19:37.310
THEN I'LL BE STRONG I.R.L., TOO,

00:19:37.352 --> 00:19:39.646
AND MAYBE EVEN FORGET
WHAT I DID.

00:19:39.687 --> 00:19:41.731
BUT JUST NOW‐‐

00:19:41.773 --> 00:19:45.568
I MEAN, WHEN DEATH GUN
HAD ME PINNED,

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.736
I WAS TERRIFIED.

00:19:46.778 --> 00:19:48.196
AND JUST LIKE THAT,

00:19:48.237 --> 00:19:50.490
I WASN'T SINON ANYMORE.

00:19:50.531 --> 00:19:52.909
I WAS THE REAL ME AGAIN.

00:19:54.035 --> 00:19:57.246
I'M SCARED TO DIE. I AM.

00:19:57.288 --> 00:20:00.875
ALTHOUGH, WHAT'S WORSE
IS LIVING WITH THIS FEAR.

00:20:00.917 --> 00:20:03.294
IT'S SO PAINFUL,
I'D RATHER BE DEAD.

00:20:03.336 --> 00:20:08.257
BUT I KNOW IF I RUN AWAY
FROM DEATH GUN AND MY PAST,

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:11.010
I'LL END UP WEAKER THAN BEFORE.

00:20:11.052 --> 00:20:13.388
I WILL. I KNOW IT.

00:20:13.429 --> 00:20:15.223
Kirito: YEAH.

00:20:15.264 --> 00:20:17.350
I GET IT.

00:20:17.392 --> 00:20:19.644
I KILLED SOMEONE ONCE, TOO.

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:20.687
Sinon: WHAT?

00:20:21.688 --> 00:20:23.314
Kirito: I MENTIONED IT ONCE,

00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:25.817
'BOUT HOW I KNEW DEATH GUN.

00:20:25.858 --> 00:20:29.278
WE FOUGHT BEFORE WHEN WE
WERE STUCK IN ANOTHER GAME.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.115
I'M SURE YOU HEARD OF IT,

00:20:32.156 --> 00:20:34.742
SWORD ART ONLINE.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.789
Sinon: OH, MY GOD. I KNEW IT.

00:20:39.831 --> 00:20:43.292
Kirito: YEAH,
I'M A SURVIVOR OF S.A.O.,

00:20:43.334 --> 00:20:46.295
AND SO IS DEATH GUN,
AND BACK THEN,

00:20:46.337 --> 00:20:48.965
HE WAS A RED PLAYER
IN THIS GUILD.

00:20:49.007 --> 00:20:51.968
THEY CALLED THEMSELVES
LAUGHING COFFIN, P.K.ERS.

00:20:53.177 --> 00:20:55.054
THEY HAD TO BE STOPPED,

00:20:55.096 --> 00:20:57.056
SO ONE DAY, A PARTY WAS FORMED

00:20:57.098 --> 00:20:58.891
TO CATCH 'EM
AND HAUL 'EM OFF TO PRISON.

00:20:58.933 --> 00:21:01.185
I WAS IN THAT PARTY.

00:21:02.186 --> 00:21:05.106
(SHUDDERS)

00:21:05.148 --> 00:21:08.860
THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT OUR PLANS,
AND THEY AMBUSHED US,

00:21:08.901 --> 00:21:12.822
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAOS,
I KILLED TWO OF LAUGHING COFFIN.

00:21:12.864 --> 00:21:14.574
I JUST...

00:21:14.615 --> 00:21:16.034
CUT 'EM DOWN.

00:21:21.664 --> 00:21:23.332
(SIGHS)

00:21:23.374 --> 00:21:24.751
AND OVER TIME,

00:21:24.792 --> 00:21:28.087
I MANAGED TO FORCE MYSELF
TO FORGET WHAT I DID,

00:21:28.129 --> 00:21:29.714
TILL YESTERDAY,

00:21:29.756 --> 00:21:32.884
WHEN I RAN INTO THE GUY
CALLING HIMSELF DEATH GUN.

00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:34.469
Sinon: AND THERE'S NO DOUBT

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.679
HE WAS WITH LAUGHING COFFIN
THAT DAY?

00:21:36.721 --> 00:21:39.098
YOU'RE SURE
HE WAS PART OF THAT AMBUSH?

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.101
Kirito: I AM,
ABOUT AS SURE AS I'LL EVER BE.

00:21:42.143 --> 00:21:45.438
HE'S ONE OF THE PLAYERS
WE TOOK TO PRISON THAT DAY.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.066
THAT'S WHY, NO MATTER WHAT,

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:51.069
I HAVE TO SETTLE THINGS
WITH HIM IN HERE

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.446
IN THIS WORLD.
