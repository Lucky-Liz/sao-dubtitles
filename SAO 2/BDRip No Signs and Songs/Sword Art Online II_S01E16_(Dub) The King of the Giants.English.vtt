00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:14.354
Kirito: WHAT'S WRONG, YUI?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.898
Yui: I HAVE A FEELING

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.234
THERE'S A LOT MORE AT STAKE HERE
THAN WE THINK.

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:23.655
THIS WILL REQUIRE
SOME EXPLAINING.

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:27.200
WHILE ALL V.R.M.M.O.s
ORIGINATE FROM THE SEED PROGRAM,

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:29.994
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THEM AND ALFHEIM ONLINE.

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:33.873
YOU SEE, A STRIPPED‐DOWN VERSION
OF THE CARDINAL SYSTEM

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:36.084
RUNS THE OTHER
ACTIVE V.R.M.M.O.s,

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:38.419
BUT THE ONE
THAT OPERATES THIS GAME

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:40.588
IS A COPY
OF THE FULL‐SPEC VERSION

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.131
THAT RAN SWORD ART ONLINE.

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:43.550
Kirito: FULL‐SPEC VERSION?

00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:46.761
Yui: THE ORIGINAL
CARDINAL SYSTEM HAD A FEATURE

00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:48.930
WHICH COULD AUTOMATICALLY
GENERATE QUESTS.

00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:52.809
IT WOULD LOG ON TO THE NET
AND SEARCH FOR VARIOUS LEGENDS

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.769
AND FOLKLORE
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:58.356
THEN IT WOULD TAKE THE STORIES
IT FOUND, ADAPT THE DATA,

00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:01.943
AND USE IT TO GENERATE
AN INFINITE NUMBER OF QUESTS.

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:03.778
Kirito: HOW ABOUT
THIS QUEST, THEN?

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.364
IS IT AUTOGENERATED
BY CARDINAL, TOO?

00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:10.201
Yui: AFTER SEEING HOW THAT NPC
WAS ACTING JUST NOW,

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:12.161
I HAVE A FEELING IT IS.

00:01:12.203 --> 00:01:15.790
IF THAT IS THE CASE HERE,
THEN NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,

00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.793
THIS QUEST WILL END
THE SAME WAY THE MYTH DOES.

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:22.004
JUST NOW, I RAN A QUICK CHECK
ON MY ARCHIVES.

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:24.840
ACCORDING TO MY DATA
AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:27.176
THE NORSE MYTHOLOGY
A.L.O. IS BASED ON,

00:01:27.218 --> 00:01:30.179
THIS QUEST MUST END
IN A FINAL WAR EVENT.

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.765
THE FROST GIANTS FROM JOTUNHEIM
AND NIFLHEIM

00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:37.144
AREN'T THE ONLY ONES
WHO WANT TO ATTACK ARUN.

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:40.564
BELOW NIFLHEIM IS A FIERY REALM
CALLED MUSPELHEIM,

00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:42.524
WHERE THE FLAME GIANTS LIVE.

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.151
ACCORDING TO THE MYTH,

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:48.155
THEY WILL ATTACK THE WORLD TREE
AND BURN IT TO THE GROUND.

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:51.867

UH‐UH. I DON'T BUY IT.

00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:55.537
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GAME SYSTEM

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.331
WOULD DESTROY ITS OWN MAPS
ON PURPOSE.

00:01:57.372 --> 00:01:58.665
IT'S GOTTA BE A MISTAKE.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.794
Yui: I'M SORRY,
BUT THERE'S NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.

00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:04.588
THE CARDINAL SYSTEM
HAS THE AUTHORITY

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:07.758
TO DESTROY ITS MAPS
IF IT WANTS. I KNOW THIS,

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.594
BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL
CARDINAL SYSTEM'S LAST TASK

00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:12.346
WAS DESTROYING AINCRAD,

00:02:12.387 --> 00:02:15.223
THE FLOATING CASTLE
OF SWORD ART ONLINE.

00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:17.809

00:02:28.862 --> 00:02:31.531

CAN'T THE SERVER BE ROLLED BACK

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:34.284
THE WAY IT WAS FROM ONE
OF THE BACKUPS IT'S MADE?

00:02:35.577 --> 00:02:37.746
Yui: THE SYSTEM HAS
AN AUTOBACKUP FEATURE,

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:39.414
BUT THOSE FILES WON'T HELP.

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:41.958
IT ONLY SAVES PLAYER DATA,
NOT FIELD DATA,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.627
SO YOU CAN'T RESTORE EVERYTHING.

THERE'S ONE THING
WE HAVEN'T TRIED YET.

IF WE USE SWORD SKILLS

AT THE PACE WE'RE GOING,

00:11:36.369 --> 00:11:38.914
WE SHOULD HAVE
MAYBE ANOTHER HOUR OR SO.

00:11:38.955 --> 00:11:39.956
Kirito: THAT'S IT?

00:11:39.998 --> 00:11:41.416
YUI, DO YOU KNOW

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:44.586
HOW BIG THESE LAST COUPLE
OF FLOORS ARE GONNA BE?

00:11:44.628 --> 00:11:46.630
Yui: YES. THE THIRD FLOOR

00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:48.924
IS ABOUT 70% THE SIZE
OF THE SECOND,

00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:51.801
AND THE FOURTH FLOOR IS
PRETTY MUCH JUST THE BOSS ROOM.

00:11:51.843 --> 00:11:53.845
Kirito: I FIGURE
THE LAST BOSS FIGHT

00:11:53.887 --> 00:11:55.722
WILL TAKE US
30 MINUTES TO FINISH.

00:11:55.764 --> 00:11:59.226
THAT MEANS WE ONLY GOT ABOUT
30 MINUTES TO GET TO HIS ROOM.

00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:00.310
Lisbeth: THAT SETTLES IT.

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:01.436
THE CLOCK'S TICKING,

00:12:01.478 --> 00:12:02.938
AND THE KING OF GIANTS
IS WAITING.

00:12:02.979 --> 00:12:05.148
LET'S GET THE LEAD OUT
AND KICK HIS GIANT ASS.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.275

YOU HEARD HER.
AS SOON AS EVERYONE'S GOT

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.743
THEIR H.P. AND M.P. RESTORED,
WE'LL HIT THAT THIRD FLOOR!

00:12:16.785 --> 00:12:17.786
All: RIGHT!

Klein: (SHRIEKS)

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:32.487

00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:34.322
LET ME OUT OF HERE.

Kirito: IT'S A TRAP.

00:13:39.035 --> 00:13:39.994
Lisbeth: IT'S A TRAP.

00:13:40.036 --> 00:13:41.996
Sinon: IT'S SO A TRAP.

00:13:42.038 --> 00:13:45.500
Klein: WELL, MAYBE IT IS.

00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:46.918
MAYBE IT ISN'T.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.836
Kirito: WHAT DO YOU THINK, YUI?

00:13:48.878 --> 00:13:51.214
Yui: SHE'S AN NPC.
HER CORE PROGRAMMING

00:13:51.256 --> 00:13:53.716
IS CONNECTED
TO THE LANGUAGE ENGINE MODULE,

00:13:53.758 --> 00:13:55.093
JUST LIKE URD'S,

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:58.471
ALTHOUGH THERE IS
ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM.

00:13:58.513 --> 00:14:00.723
THIS ONE HAS AN H.P. GAUGE.

00:14:00.765 --> 00:14:02.725
Kirito: YEAH,
THAT'S A BIG RED FLAG.

00:14:02.767 --> 00:14:05.853
IF SHE'S GOT AN H.P. GAUGE,
WE MIGHT HAVE TO FIGHT HER.

00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:08.022
‐ Asuna: A TRAP.
‐ Silica: TOTALLY A TRAP.

00:14:08.064 --> 00:14:09.691
‐ Leafa: OBVIOUSLY A TRAP.
‐ Pina: (SQUAWKS)

00:14:09.732 --> 00:14:12.319
Kirito: IT MIGHT BE A TRAP.
IT MIGHT NOT. I DON'T KNOW.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.696
EITHER WAY, WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO TAKE THE CHANCE.

00:14:14.738 --> 00:14:16.615
WE CAN'T WASTE ANY MORE TIME.

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:18.533
WE GOTTA GET TO THRYMR ASAP.

00:14:18.575 --> 00:14:20.243
Klein: OH, RIGHT. YEAH.

00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:22.287
WE GOT A JOB TO DO.

00:14:25.165 --> 00:14:27.375

00:14:27.417 --> 00:14:29.377
I BEG YOU.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.218
Klein: I KNOW IT'S A TRAP.

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:38.637
I'M NOT STUPID.

00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:41.473
BUT EVEN IF IT IS A TRAP,

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:43.475
EVEN IF I KNOW IT'S A TRAP,

00:14:43.517 --> 00:14:45.185
I DON'T CARE!

00:14:45.227 --> 00:14:49.189
I CAN'T JUST TURN MY BACK
ON SOMEONE IF THEY NEED HELP!

00:14:49.231 --> 00:14:52.692
EVEN IF‐‐EVEN IF IT MEANS
WE FAIL THE QUEST

00:14:52.734 --> 00:14:54.778
AND EVEN IF ARUN GETS DESTROYED,

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.573
IF I GOT A CHANCE TO DO
SOME GOOD FOR SOMEONE, I WILL,

00:14:58.615 --> 00:15:00.992
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT BEING
A SAMURAI'S ALL ABOUT!

THE WAY OUT'S
KIND OF FAR, DOLLFACE.

00:15:32.357 --> 00:15:35.360
YOU GONNA BE OKAY
TO MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN?

Woman: I COULD,

00:15:38.947 --> 00:15:42.242
BUT I'M AFRAID I CANNOT LEAVE
THE CASTLE JUST YET.

00:15:42.284 --> 00:15:45.871
FOR, YOU SEE, I MUST FIRST
RETRIEVE MY PEOPLE'S TREASURE,

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:47.455
WHICH KING THRYMR STOLE.

00:15:47.497 --> 00:15:49.457
IF YOU WOULD, FAERIE SWORDSMAN,

00:15:49.499 --> 00:15:52.085
PLEASE LET ME ACCOMPANY YOU
TO THRYMR'S ROOM.

00:15:52.127 --> 00:15:54.004
Klein: (GASPING)

DON'T YOU THINK?

00:15:57.883 --> 00:15:59.050
Kirito: UH‐HUH.

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:01.344

Kirito: (SIGHS)

00:16:03.722 --> 00:16:06.725
ALL RIGHT.
I CAN'T STAND SEEING YOU BEG.

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:09.978
SINCE WE ONLY GOT A LITTLE
FURTHER TO GO BEFORE THE END

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.231
AND SEEING AS HOW WE DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE IT'S A TRAP...

00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:16.651
Klein: YES!

00:16:16.693 --> 00:16:17.944
YOU HEAR THAT?

00:16:17.986 --> 00:16:19.613
YOU'RE COMING WITH US, GORGEOUS.

00:16:19.654 --> 00:16:21.823
WE'LL HELP YOU BEAT
THAT JERK THRYMR.

00:16:21.865 --> 00:16:24.743
WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT NOW,
SO LET'S GET WET TOGETHER.

COMMENT FROM YOUR MEMORY, YUI.

00:16:42.802 --> 00:16:45.096
Kirito: HUH. SHE MUST BE A MAGE.

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:46.473
HER M.P.'s REALLY HIGH.

00:16:50.602 --> 00:16:53.021
WITH THE WAY THEY GOT
THIS DUNGEON LAID OUT,

00:16:53.063 --> 00:16:55.607
THE FINAL BOSS ROOM
SHOULD BE DOWN THOSE STAIRS.

00:16:55.649 --> 00:16:57.150
REMEMBER, HE'S THE LAST BOSS,

00:16:57.192 --> 00:17:00.487
SO HE'S GONNA BE WAY STRONGER
THAN THE OTHER ONES.

00:17:00.528 --> 00:17:03.156
WHEN YOU HIT HIM,
HIT FAST, AND HIT HARD.

00:17:03.198 --> 00:17:05.784
UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT
HIS ATTACK PATTERNS,

00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:07.160
WE'LL BE ON THE DEFENSIVE,

00:17:07.202 --> 00:17:09.329
SO NO ONE MOVES ON HIM
TILL I SAY.

00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:12.707
ONE LAST THING. IF YOU SEE
HIS GAUGE DROP TO YELLOW OR RED,

00:17:12.749 --> 00:17:15.627
HIS ATTACK PATTERNS ARE GONNA
CHANGE BIG‐TIME, SO WATCH OUT.

YOU COULD STEAL MY TREASURE?

IF YOU TELL ME
WHERE I CAN FIND THAT WOMAN,

TO YOUR REIGN OF EVIL.

00:20:53.136 --> 00:20:55.138
RETURN MY TREASURE IMMEDIATELY!

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.349
Thrmyr: YES,
THAT'S THE SPIRIT, MY LOVELY.

00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:01.227
I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS
FROM THE WOMAN

00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:04.522
WHOSE BEAUTY AND VALOR
ARE KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE LAND.

00:21:04.564 --> 00:21:07.484
AND AS THEY SAY,
THE MORE NOBLE THE FLOWER,

00:21:07.525 --> 00:21:09.819
THE MORE SATISFYING IT IS
TO PLUCK.

00:21:09.861 --> 00:21:12.489
AFTER I'VE SNUFFED THE LIFE
FROM THESE INSECTS,

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.742
I SHALL SHOWER YOU
WITH EXTRA AFFECTION.

00:21:15.784 --> 00:21:18.328
(CHUCKLING)

00:21:22.791 --> 00:21:24.876
Klein: YOU BASTARD.

00:21:24.918 --> 00:21:26.586
OVER MY DEAD BODY!

00:21:26.628 --> 00:21:30.590
I, LORD KLEIN, WON'T LET YOU
LAY A FINGER ON LADY FREYJA!

00:21:30.632 --> 00:21:32.467
Thrmyr: (CHUCKLES)

00:21:32.509 --> 00:21:36.262
LISTEN TO THE ANGRY LITTLE FLY
BUZZING AWAY.

00:21:36.304 --> 00:21:38.389
NOW, THEN, IT IS TIME

00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:41.851
I BEGAN CELEBRATING
MY CONQUEST OF JOTUNHEIM.

00:21:41.893 --> 00:21:44.896
I SHALL START
BY CRUSHING THE LIFE FROM YOU.

00:21:50.777 --> 00:21:52.070
Kirito: HEH.

00:21:52.111 --> 00:21:53.238
IT'S ON!

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:55.031
LISTEN TO YUI, GUYS!

00:21:55.073 --> 00:21:56.699
DON'T ATTACK TILL SHE SAYS!

00:21:56.741 --> 00:21:58.660
All: YOU GOT IT!
