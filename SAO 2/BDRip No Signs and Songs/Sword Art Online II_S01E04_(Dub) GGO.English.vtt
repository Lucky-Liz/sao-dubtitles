WEBVTT

00:00:02.342 --> 00:00:04.636
Kazuto:
I'M NINETY‐NINE PERCENT SURE

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:06.554
THE DEATH GUN STORY'S A HOAX,

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:09.057
PROBABLY SOMEONE TROLLING.

00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:11.851
YOU CAN'T KILL SOMEONE
IN THE REAL WORLD

00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:13.269
FROM THE VIRTUAL ANYMORE.

00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:15.230
I KNOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:19.025
BUT THERE'S STILL
THAT ONE PERCENT CHANCE

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:20.985
IT COULD BE TRUE.

00:00:21.027 --> 00:00:22.737
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:27.492
LINK START!

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:48.596
IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT
THAN A.L.O.

00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:53.685
GO FIGURE. KILLING PEOPLE'S
THE POINT IN HERE.

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:56.771
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:02.151
HMM?

00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:06.948
(GASPS)

00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:42.837
(GASPS)

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.632
HOLY CRAP!

00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:59.562
I WISH I LOOKED
A LITTLE MORE SOLDIERISH.

00:02:59.604 --> 00:03:01.481
Player: HOLY BAZONGERS!

00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:03.650
THAT'S THE F‐1300 MODEL,
ISN'T IT?!

00:03:03.692 --> 00:03:05.485
THAT AVATAR'S SO RARE,

00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:07.278
I'VE ONLY HEARD ABOUT THEM
TILL NOW.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.780
I WANT IT.

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:10.782
I'LL GIVE YOU TWO MEGA‐CREDITS
FOR YOUR ACCOUNT.

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:12.659
COME ON, LADY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:13.952
Kirito: L‐LADY?

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:14.994
(GASPS)

00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:22.127
UM, HATE TO BREAK IT YOU, GUY,

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.753
BUT I'M A GUY, TOO.

00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:25.046
Player: HOLY CRAP!

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:26.840
THEN THAT MEANS
YOU GOT THE M‐9000 MODEL!

00:03:26.881 --> 00:03:29.008
I'LL GIVE YOU FOUR,
NO, FIVE FOR IT.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.678
SELL IT TO ME.
COME ON. SELL IT TO ME.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.056
Kirito: SORRY, BUT THIS
ISN'T A DEFAULT AVATAR.

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:36.391
IT'S A CONVERTED ONE.

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.601
I CAN'T EXCHANGE IT FOR CASH.

00:03:38.643 --> 00:03:40.937
Player: AWW, THAT SUCKS.

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:44.566
Kirito: YEAH, WELL, LATER.

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:46.985
Player: HEY, IF YOU
EVER CHANGE YOUR MIND,

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.486
GIVE ME THE FIRST BID.

00:03:49.904 --> 00:03:51.156
Kirito: (GROANS)

00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:59.414
IF I WANT TO GET
DEATH GUN'S ATTENTION,

00:03:59.456 --> 00:04:02.375
I HAVE TO MAKE A NAME
FOR MYSELF FIRST.

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:04.043
Player 2: (WHISTLES)

00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:05.211
Player 3: LOOKING FOR
SOME ACTION? 'CAUSE HERE IT IS.

00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:06.254
WHAT? ARE YOU TOO GOOD FOR ME?

00:04:33.197 --> 00:04:34.782
Kirito: I'M TOTALLY LOST.

00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:38.327
SOME SHORTCUT
THIS TURNED OUT TO BE.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.915
UH, EXCUSE ME.

00:04:42.957 --> 00:04:45.001
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE...

00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:49.088
UH‐OH.
SHE THINKS I'M HITTING ON HER.

00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:52.633
Sinon: YEAH? WHAT?

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:54.176
Kirito: UH...

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.099
Sinon: YOUR FIRST TIME
IN THE GAME, HUH?

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.020
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:05.438
I, UM...

00:05:07.023 --> 00:05:08.566
OH, MY GOD.

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:11.193
SHE THINKS I'M A GIRL, TOO.

00:05:11.235 --> 00:05:13.070
Sinon: WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO?

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.447
Kirito: UH...

00:05:14.488 --> 00:05:16.907
I, UH...

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.576
(CHUCKLES)

00:05:19.744 --> 00:05:21.746
(GROANING)

00:05:30.338 --> 00:05:32.340
YES, IT'S MY FIRST TIME.

00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:35.426
I'M LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO BUY A CHEAP GUN.

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:39.347
OH, AND I ALSO NEED TO FIND OUT
WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS.

00:05:39.388 --> 00:05:40.348
(GIGGLES)

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.266
Sinon: OH. SURE.

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:44.602
I CAN SHOW YOU.

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:46.354
Kirito: IT'S NOT COOL,

00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:50.274
BUT I'LL LET HER KEEP THINKING
I'M A GIRL FOR A WHILE.

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:53.736
Sinon: BY THE WAY,

00:05:53.778 --> 00:05:56.072
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE?

00:05:56.113 --> 00:05:58.282
Kirito: UH, I WANTED
TO SIGN MYSELF UP

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:00.618
FOR AN EVENT
CALLED BULLET OF BULLETS.

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.119
Sinon: B.o.B.?

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:05.790
OKAY, BUT YOU JUST STARTED
PLAYING TODAY, RIGHT?

00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:06.916
Kirito: YES.

00:06:06.957 --> 00:06:08.834
Sinon: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

00:06:08.876 --> 00:06:11.837
YOUR STATS MAY NOT BE
HIGH ENOUGH FOR THAT.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.923
Kirito: OH.
WELL, I CONVERTED,

00:06:13.964 --> 00:06:17.176
SO ALL MY SKILLS HAVE BEEN
TRANSFERRED FROM ANOTHER GAME.

00:06:17.218 --> 00:06:18.844
Sinon: IF YOU SAY SO.

00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:23.891
SO, ANYWAY, YOU PICKED
A HECK OF A GAME TO PLAY.

00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:26.644
IT'S ALL GRIMY
AND STINKS OF OIL.

00:06:26.685 --> 00:06:30.231
Kirito: MM, WELL, I'VE ONLY
PLAYED FANTASY GAMES UP TO NOW.

00:06:30.272 --> 00:06:33.859
THEY'RE FUN, BUT I THOUGHT
I'D TRY A CYBER‐GAME FOR ONCE.

00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:40.074
I WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN SEEING
WHAT GUN BATTLES WERE LIKE.

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:41.367
Sinon: REALLY?

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.744
IT TAKES GUTS TO WANT
TO START WITH B.o.B.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.371
RIGHT OFF THE BAT LIKE THAT.

00:06:45.412 --> 00:06:46.747
Kirito: (CHUCKLES)

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.125
Sinon: LET'S HOOK YOU UP
WITH A GUN THEN.

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:51.335
I KNOW THIS GREAT MARKET.
IT'S DOWN HERE.

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:52.753
Kirito: OKAY.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.270
WOW. THIS PLACE LOOKS
LIKE IT HAS EVERYTHING.

00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:11.897
Sinon: YEAH, WELL,
THE TWO TYPES OF WEAPONS

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.899
THAT ARE MOSTLY USED IN G.G.O.

00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:15.734
ARE OPTICAL GUNS
AND LIVE‐AMMO GUNS.

00:07:15.776 --> 00:07:16.902
Kirito: HUH.

00:07:16.944 --> 00:07:18.529
Sinon:
AN OPTICAL GUN'S LIGHTER

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:20.906
AND MORE ACCURATE,
BUT IT HAS ITS DRAWBACKS.

00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:22.992
IF YOUR OPPONENT
EQUIPS THEIR DEFENSE SHIELD,

00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:24.785
IT ONLY DOES HALF THE DAMAGE.

00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:27.163
FOR A ONE‐ON‐ONE TOURNEY
LIKE B.o.B.,

00:07:27.204 --> 00:07:29.165
A LIVE‐AMMO GUN'S THE BEST BET.

00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:30.416
Kirito: OH. OKAY.

00:07:32.376 --> 00:07:35.171
Sinon: ALL RIGHT,
LET'S START WITH YOUR STATS,

00:07:35.212 --> 00:07:36.672
HIGHEST ONE FIRST.

00:07:36.714 --> 00:07:39.884
Kirito: UM, I GUESS
MY STRENGTH IS THE HIGHEST,

00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:42.178
AND SPEED AFTER THAT.

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:45.890
Sinon: YOU'RE
AN STR‐AGI TYPE, HUH?

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:49.101
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT TWO CHOICES
FOR YOUR MAIN WEAPON,

00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:52.980
EITHER A HEAVY ASSAULT RIFLE
OR A LARGE‐CALIBER MACHINE GUN.

00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:54.565
WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE,

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:58.485
YOU'RE ALSO GONNA NEED A HANDGUN
FOR A BACKUP WEAPON.

00:07:58.527 --> 00:07:59.945
OH, WAIT A SEC.

00:07:59.987 --> 00:08:02.615
YOU SAID YOU JUST
CONVERTED OVER, DIDN'T YOU?

00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.200
DO YOU HAVE ANY CREDITS?

00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:05.576
Kirito: YEAH, I SHOULD.

00:08:06.577 --> 00:08:08.412
LET'S SEE.

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.539
IT SAYS I HAVE
A THOUSAND CREDITS.

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.750
Sinon: EVERYBODY GETS THAT
WHEN THEY START.

00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:14.543
Kirito: OH. (LAUGHS)

00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:16.587
Sinon: HMM.
IF THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE,

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:19.757
THE MOST YOU CAN AFFORD'S
GONNA BE A SMALL RAY GUN.

00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:21.217
AND FOR A LIVE‐AMMO GUN,

00:08:21.258 --> 00:08:23.636
A THOUSAND WON'T EVEN
GET YOU A USED REVOLVER.

00:08:25.846 --> 00:08:28.098
LISTEN, IF YOU WANT,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.726
I COULD LOAN YOU THE MONEY
TO BUY A GUN.

00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:32.519
Kirito:
THAT'S REALLY SWEET OF YOU,

00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:34.313
BUT I COULDN'T. UH, I KNOW.

00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:36.232
DOES THIS GAME
HAVE ANYTHING IN IT

00:08:36.273 --> 00:08:39.443
WHERE A NEW PLAYER LIKE ME
COULD GO EARN SOME MONEY?

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:41.195
Sinon: WELL,
I DON'T RECOMMEND THEM,

00:08:41.237 --> 00:08:44.240
BUT THERE ARE CASINOS
AND GAMBLING GAMES,

00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:45.449
LIKE THAT ONE.

00:08:51.455 --> 00:08:53.541
Gunslinger:
HEY, CHICKEN, COME ON.

00:08:53.582 --> 00:08:55.709
Kirito: HOW DO YOU PLAY?

00:08:55.751 --> 00:08:57.294
Sinon: YOU ENTER
THROUGH THAT GATE

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:59.713
AND GO DOWN THE ALLEY,
DODGING THE NPC's BULLETS.

00:08:59.755 --> 00:09:01.131
THE IDEA IS TO GET

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:03.717
AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN TO HIM
WITHOUT GETTING SHOT.

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:05.135
IF YOU CAN TOUCH HIM,

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:07.596
YOU WIN ALL THE CASH
EVERYONE'S SUNK INTO IT

00:09:07.638 --> 00:09:09.473
SINCE THE LAST TIME
IT WAS BEAT.

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:10.683
Kirito: ALL OF IT?!

00:09:10.724 --> 00:09:12.810
Sinon: THREE HUNDRED THOU
AND CHANGE.

00:09:12.851 --> 00:09:15.312
Kirito: NOW, THAT IS
A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY.

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:17.773
Sinon: WELL,
NO ONE'S BEATEN IT.

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:20.609
ONCE YOU GET EIGHT METERS
AWAY FROM THE GUNSLINGER,

00:09:20.651 --> 00:09:22.820
HE SWITCHES TO THIS
WICKED‐FAST QUICK‐DRAW MODE.

00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:25.990
BY THE TIME YOU SEE
THE BULLET LINES, IT'S TOO LATE.

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:27.616
Kirito: THE BULLET LINES?

00:09:27.658 --> 00:09:28.951
Sinon: LOOK.
ANOTHER SUCKER'S

00:09:28.993 --> 00:09:30.744
STEPPING UP
TO ADD TO THE JACKPOT.

00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:32.204
Player 4:
TODAY'S THE DAY, MAN.

00:09:32.246 --> 00:09:33.539
Player 5: YEAH, YOU GOT THIS.

00:09:33.581 --> 00:09:34.707
Player 6: HERE GOES NOTHIN'.

00:09:39.962 --> 00:09:41.505
Gunslinger:
I'M GONNA BLAST YOU

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:43.632
FROM HERE TO THE MOON,
YA VARMINT.

00:09:43.674 --> 00:09:46.135
Players: (LAUGHING)

00:09:46.176 --> 00:09:48.262
Player 7: HURRY UP,
AND DIE ALREADY.

00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:50.889
Player 6: WATCH ME CLEAR
THIS BEEYOTCH IN NOTHING FLAT.

00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:52.016
Player 4: JACKPOT'S YOURS.

00:09:52.057 --> 00:09:53.767
Player 6: YEAH, YOU KNOW IT.

00:10:03.027 --> 00:10:05.988
Kirito: WHY'S HE DOING THAT?

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.243
Spectators: (CHEERING)

00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:12.911
Kirito: WAS THAT
THE BULLET LINE?

00:10:12.953 --> 00:10:15.539
Sinon: YEP.
IT'S A DEFENSIVE SYSTEM ASSIST.

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:16.749
WE ALL HAVE IT.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.417
EXCEPT FOR
A SNIPER'S FIRST SHOT,

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:20.336
BULLET PREDICTION LINES

00:10:20.377 --> 00:10:22.296
ALWAYS SHOW UP
IN THE TARGET'S FIELD OF VISION.

00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:31.930
Gunslinger: I'LL KILL YA.

00:10:31.972 --> 00:10:34.391
Player 6: WHATEVER.
(LAUGHS)

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:36.518
Player 4: RUN, MAN!
Player 5: YOU SO GOT THIS!

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:38.812
Gunslinger: YOU LOSER.

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.616
GAME OVER, HOSS.

00:10:53.702 --> 00:10:54.995
Player 8: WELL, THAT SUCKED.

00:10:55.037 --> 00:10:56.622
Player 9: THAT GUY
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

00:10:56.664 --> 00:10:57.623
Sinon: SEE?

00:10:57.665 --> 00:10:59.166
THAT ALLEY IS SO NARROW,

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:01.585
YOU CAN'T MOVE
TOO FAR TO EITHER SIDE,

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:04.254
AND YOU'RE FORCED TO CHARGE
THE GUNSLINGER STRAIGHT ON.

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:06.548
THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR
AS ANYONE'S GOTTEN.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.384
Kirito: AH, I GET IT.

00:11:08.425 --> 00:11:11.053
IF I WAIT TO SEE
THE BULLET LINES,

00:11:11.095 --> 00:11:12.638
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.015
Sinon: UH, HEY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:22.356
Player 6: TEN CREDS SAYS

00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:23.982
THE NEWBIE GETS IT
OUT OF THE GATE.

00:11:24.024 --> 00:11:25.275
Player 9: WHOA.

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:26.860
THAT'S THE CUTEST TARGET
I EVER SEEN.

00:11:26.902 --> 00:11:28.696
Player 8: LET'S STICK AROUND
AND WATCH HER GET PWNED.

00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:37.705
Gunslinger: I'LL KILL YA.

00:11:50.217 --> 00:11:51.427
YOU LOSER.

00:11:56.557 --> 00:11:58.058
Sinon: YOU'RE KIDDING.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.977
Player 6: SHE PASSED
THE TEN‐METER MARK.

00:12:00.018 --> 00:12:02.354
Player 4:
THAT IS ONE FAST KID.

00:12:03.397 --> 00:12:04.606
Gunslinger: DIE, YOU VARMINT.

00:12:07.025 --> 00:12:09.278
I'LL BLAST YOU TO HELL!

00:12:13.574 --> 00:12:15.367
Kirito: LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S OUT OF BULLETS.

00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:36.138
Gunslinger: NO!

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:55.616
HEY, CHICKEN, COME ON.

00:12:55.657 --> 00:12:57.743
Player 9:
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

00:12:57.785 --> 00:12:59.620
Player 8: WHO IS THAT KID?

00:13:00.621 --> 00:13:01.830
Sinon: OH, MY GOD.

00:13:01.872 --> 00:13:04.124
I'VE NEVER SEEN
REFLEXES LIKE THAT.

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.918
I MEAN, AT THE END,

00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:09.421
YOU DODGED HIS LASERS
FROM ABOUT TWO METERS AWAY.

00:13:09.463 --> 00:13:12.382
AT THAT RANGE, THE TIME BETWEEN
YOU SEEING THE BULLET LINES

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:14.301
AND THE SHOTS FIRED‐‐
WELL, THAT'S IT.

00:13:14.343 --> 00:13:16.428
THERE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ANY TIME BETWEEN 'EM.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.138
Kirito: OH. UM...

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.389
REALLY?

00:13:22.518 --> 00:13:25.145
WELL, SINCE IT'S A GAME
OF DODGING BULLETS,

00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:27.147
I JUST PREDICTED
THE BULLET LINES.

00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:28.816
YOU KNOW,
PREDICT THE PREDICTIONS.

00:13:28.857 --> 00:13:30.234
(CROWD MURMURING)

00:13:30.275 --> 00:13:34.279
Sinon: YOU‐‐YOU PREDICTED
THE PREDICTIONS?!

00:13:34.321 --> 00:13:35.697
Gunslinger: HUH?

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:38.660
(KIRITO GROANS)

00:13:38.702 --> 00:13:40.537
I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THE SPECS

00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:41.872
FOR THIS ASSAULT RIFLE.

00:13:41.913 --> 00:13:43.415
I MEAN,
THIS THING'S GINORMOUS,

00:13:43.457 --> 00:13:45.959
SO WHY'S THE CALIBER
OF THE BULLETS IT FIRES

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:47.377
SMALLER THAN
A SUBMACHINE GUN'S?

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:50.213
Sinon: I'M CONFUSED
ABOUT HOW SOMEONE LIKE YOU

00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:52.841
CAN DODGE BULLETS LIKE A GHOST
AND NOT KNOW THAT.

00:13:52.883 --> 00:13:55.260
YOU CONVERTED
FROM ANOTHER GAME.

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:57.262
WHAT'D YOU PLAY
BEFORE THIS ONE?

00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:58.680
Kirito: NOTHING SPECIAL.

00:13:58.722 --> 00:14:01.641
JUST ONE OF THOSE TYPICAL
FANTASY GAMES, IS ALL.

00:14:01.683 --> 00:14:03.477
Sinon: HMM.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.481
YEAH, SO YOU SAID.

00:14:07.522 --> 00:14:09.149
WELL, DURING THE B.o.B. PRELIMS,

00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:11.985
I'LL GET AN IDEA
OF WHAT YOU CAN REALLY DO.

00:14:12.027 --> 00:14:13.445
Kirito: (LAUGHS)

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:15.197
Sinon: AS FOR
THE ASSAULT RIFLE,

00:14:15.238 --> 00:14:18.200
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
IT USES A SMALL CALIBER?

00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:19.618
Kirito: SURE.

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:23.038
Sinon: IT ALL GOES BACK
TO THE M16 FROM THE U. S.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.707
THEY DESIGNED IT FOR PRECISION
AND PENETRATIVE POWER,

00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:28.001
BUT USING A FAST,
SMALL‐CALIBER ROUND.

00:14:30.962 --> 00:14:33.632
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW
THAT STUFF, THOUGH.

00:14:33.673 --> 00:14:35.759
NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT
THREE HUNDRED K,

00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:38.386
YOU CAN BUY PRETTY MUCH
WHATEVER GUN YOU WANT.

00:14:38.428 --> 00:14:40.555
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO WHAT YOU WANT

00:14:40.597 --> 00:14:42.933
AND WHAT YOU THINK'LL
WORK BEST FOR YOU.

00:14:42.974 --> 00:14:44.768
Kirito:
WHAT DOES WORK FOR ME?

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.436
HMM.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.816
HEY, WHAT ARE THESE?

00:14:52.818 --> 00:14:55.403
Sinon: OH, THOSE ARE
PHOTON SWORDS.

00:14:55.445 --> 00:14:56.738
Kirito: PHOTON.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.490
Sinon: IT'S A BEAM OF LIGHT

00:14:58.532 --> 00:15:00.325
THAT'S A WAVE
AND A PARTICLE.

00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:01.910
PHOTON SWORD'S
THE OFFICIAL NAME,

00:15:01.952 --> 00:15:04.579
BUT PEOPLE CALL 'EM
LASER BLADES, BEAM SABERS,

00:15:04.621 --> 00:15:06.498
AND SOMETHING ELSE
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.292
Kirito: OH, COOL!
YOU CAN USE A SWORD HERE?

00:15:09.334 --> 00:15:12.129
Sinon: YEAH, IF YOU WANT,
BUT NOBODY REALLY USES THEM.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.547
Kirito: WHY DON'T THEY?

00:15:13.588 --> 00:15:16.299
Sinon: WELL, I MEAN,
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE IT

00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:17.843
UNLESS YOU'RE CLOSE
TO YOUR TARGET,

00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:20.137
AND IF YOU'RE CRAZY ENOUGH
TO GET THAT CLOSE,

00:15:20.178 --> 00:15:22.722
YOU'LL GET SHOT
FULL OF HOLES.

00:15:22.764 --> 00:15:24.099
Kirito:
SO BASICALLY IT'S GOOD

00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:26.059
AS LONG AS YOU
GET CLOSE ENOUGH.

00:15:26.101 --> 00:15:27.561
Sinon: YEAH, I GUESS,

00:15:27.602 --> 00:15:29.229
BUT EVEN WITH
YOUR SKILL AT DODGING,

00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:33.316
IF THERE'S A FULL‐AUTO GUN
FIRING AT YO‐‐

00:15:33.358 --> 00:15:35.152
UGH.

00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:37.779
Robot: WELCOME, PLAYER.

00:15:42.701 --> 00:15:44.286
Kirito: THANK YOU.

00:15:45.412 --> 00:15:47.622
Robot: THANK YOU
FOR YOUR PURCHASE.

00:15:47.664 --> 00:15:49.249
HAVE A NICE DAY.

00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:50.333
Sinon: OH, WELL.

00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:52.169
I GUESS
WHEN IT COMES TO COMBAT,

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.753
EVERYONE'S GOT
THEIR OWN STYLE.

00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:56.673
Kirito: THE WAY I SEE IT,
IF THIS PLACE SELLS SOMETHING,

00:15:56.715 --> 00:15:58.633
IT MUST BE OKAY FOR BATTLE,
EVEN THIS.

00:16:02.137 --> 00:16:03.513
Both: WHOA.

00:16:10.687 --> 00:16:12.022
Sinon: HUH.

00:16:12.063 --> 00:16:15.025
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

00:16:21.823 --> 00:16:23.491
WOW.

00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:26.119
THOSE ARE
YOUR FANTASY GAME SKILLS?

00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:27.412
NOT BAD.

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:30.415
Kirito: I KNOW
A COUPLE OF MOVES.

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:31.917
THIS SURE IS LIGHT.

00:16:34.711 --> 00:16:35.879
Sinon: HUH?

00:16:41.384 --> 00:16:43.178
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE DEAD SET

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.013
ON THAT FOR YOUR MAIN WEAPON,

00:16:45.055 --> 00:16:47.182
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE
A SUBMACHINE GUN

00:16:47.224 --> 00:16:49.351
OR A HANDGUN
IN YOUR INVENTORY, TOO.

00:16:49.392 --> 00:16:52.812
IT'LL DISTRACT YOUR ENEMY
SO YOU CAN GET CLOSER.

00:16:52.854 --> 00:16:54.481
Kirito: OH, OKAY.

00:16:54.522 --> 00:16:56.775
Sinon: HOW MUCH
DO YOU HAVE LEFT?

00:16:56.816 --> 00:16:58.401
Kirito: ABOUT A HUNDRED‐FIFTY K.

00:16:58.443 --> 00:17:01.071
Sinon: WHOA. THOSE
PHOTON THINGIES ARE EXPENSIVE.

00:17:01.112 --> 00:17:03.740
YOU GOT
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY K, HUH?

00:17:03.782 --> 00:17:06.034
YOU STILL NEED TO GET
PROTECTIVE GEAR,

00:17:06.076 --> 00:17:08.995
SOME KIND OF WEAPON,
AND THE AMMO FOR IT.

00:17:09.037 --> 00:17:10.455
WHAT'S CHEAP, BUT GOOD?

00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:13.875
Kirito: I'LL TRUST
YOUR JUDGMENT WITH ALL THAT.

00:17:14.878 --> 00:17:16.088
Sinon: FOR B.o.B.,

00:17:16.129 --> 00:17:19.007
A LIVE‐AMMO WEAPON'S
YOUR BEST BET.

00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:22.678
IF I WERE YOU, I'D GO FOR
ACCURACY OVER STOPPING POWER.

00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:24.096
HMM.

00:17:24.137 --> 00:17:27.182
OH. YOU'LL SPEND MOST
OF YOUR CREDITS ON IT,

00:17:27.224 --> 00:17:28.517
BUT THIS ONE'S GOOD,

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.769
THE FN FIVE SEVEN.

00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:32.771
Kirito: WHAT'S FIVE SEVEN?

00:17:32.813 --> 00:17:34.189
Sinon: THE BULLET CALIBER,

00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:36.441
5.7 MILLIMETERS.

00:17:36.483 --> 00:17:37.568
THEY'RE SMALLER THAN

00:17:37.609 --> 00:17:38.735
THE NINE‐MILL
PARABELLUM BULLETS,

00:17:38.777 --> 00:17:40.487
BUT THEY STILL PACK A PUNCH.

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:42.698
THEY'RE SIMILAR IN SHAPE
TO RIFLE BULLETS,

00:17:42.739 --> 00:17:43.907
SO THEY'VE GOT THE EDGE

00:17:43.949 --> 00:17:46.410
IN BOTH PRECISION
AND STOPPING POWER.

00:17:46.451 --> 00:17:48.412
Kirito: HUH.

00:17:48.453 --> 00:17:50.414
Sinon: HEY, ARE YOU
EVEN LISTENING?

00:17:50.455 --> 00:17:52.499
Kirito: HUH? OH, YEAH.

00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:54.209
I GUESS I'LL BUY
THAT ONE THEN.

00:17:54.251 --> 00:17:57.170
IS THAT IT,
OR DO I NEED ANYTHING ELSE?

00:17:57.212 --> 00:18:00.048
Sinon: YEAH, YOU DO.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A HOLSTER,

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.801
SOME EXTRA MAGS,
SOME PROTECTIVE GEAR.

00:18:02.843 --> 00:18:06.930
AND YOU SHOULD ALSO GET YOURSELF
A DEFENSE FIELD AND RANGE TIME.

00:18:06.972 --> 00:18:08.307
Kirito: WHAT'S THAT?

00:18:08.348 --> 00:18:11.268
Sinon: YOU NEVER FIRED
A GUN BEFORE, HAVE YOU?

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.436
Kirito: UH‐UH, NEVER.

00:18:12.477 --> 00:18:14.479
Sinon: LET'S CHANGE THAT.

00:18:20.193 --> 00:18:21.361
Kirito: (GROANS)

00:18:21.403 --> 00:18:23.739
Sinon: IF YOU BUY A GUN
FROM THE SHOP,

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.157
YOU CAN TEST IT HERE.

00:18:29.077 --> 00:18:31.288
KNOW HOW TO HOLD IT?

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.497
Kirito: I GUESS.

00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:37.044
IT'S LIGHTER THAN I THOUGHT.

00:18:37.085 --> 00:18:38.712
Sinon: THAT'S 'CAUSE
THAT MODEL'S

00:18:38.754 --> 00:18:40.631
MADE OF REINFORCED PLASTIC.

00:18:40.672 --> 00:18:42.424
THE RECOIL
ISN'T TOO BAD ON IT.

00:18:42.466 --> 00:18:44.760
STILL, YOU SHOULD GRIP IT
WITH BOTH HANDS.

00:18:44.801 --> 00:18:47.179
AND KEEP YOUR LEFT EYE OPEN.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.430
Kirito: OH, OKAY.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.899
(HEART BEATING)

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.902
Sinon: SO RIGHT NOW,
YOU SHOULD BE SEEING

00:19:01.943 --> 00:19:04.029
A GREEN CIRCLE
IN YOUR FIELD OF VISION.

00:19:04.071 --> 00:19:05.822
Kirito: IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE

00:19:05.864 --> 00:19:07.574
SHRINKING AND EXPANDING
LIKE THAT?

00:19:07.616 --> 00:19:08.867
Sinon: YEP.

00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:10.535
IT'S CALLED
THE BULLET CIRCLE,

00:19:10.577 --> 00:19:12.287
YOUR OFFENSIVE ASSIST SYSTEM.

00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:14.623
YOUR BULLETS'LL HIT
THE TARGET AT RANDOM

00:19:14.665 --> 00:19:16.458
INSIDE THE CIRCLE.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.627
Kirito: HOW DO I BOOST
MY ACCURACY?

00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:22.798
Sinon: I GUESS THE EASIEST WAY
IS TO GET CLOSER TO YOUR TARGET.

00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:24.257
Kirito: WHAT ELSE?

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:25.926
Sinon: TRY TO STAY CALM.

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:27.844
THE FASTER YOUR HEART BEATS,

00:19:27.886 --> 00:19:29.971
THE MORE THE CIRCLE EXPANDS.

00:19:32.224 --> 00:19:33.684
Kirito: THIS IS
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

00:19:54.788 --> 00:19:55.747
NO WAY.

00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:57.165
I MISSED?

00:19:57.207 --> 00:19:58.667
Sinon: WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?

00:19:58.709 --> 00:20:00.669
IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.673
Kirito: THANK YOU FOR GOING
OUT OF YOUR WAY FOR ME.

00:20:04.715 --> 00:20:06.007
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:08.301
Sinon: MM‐MMM.
I WAS HAPPY TO HELP.

00:20:08.343 --> 00:20:09.970
THERE AREN'T
MANY GIRL PLAYERS HERE.

00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:12.806
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING,
SO IT WAS A GOOD WAY

00:20:12.848 --> 00:20:15.100
TO KILL SOME TIME
BEFORE THE PRELIMS.

00:20:15.142 --> 00:20:17.602
Kirito: WAIT. YOU'RE GONNA
COMPETE IN B.o.B., TOO?

00:20:17.644 --> 00:20:21.189
Sinon: UH‐HUH. I WAS
ON MY WAY TO SIGN UP BEFORE...

00:20:22.858 --> 00:20:24.025
OH, MY GOD.

00:20:24.067 --> 00:20:25.318
THEY'RE CLOSING SOON.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.987
Kirito: REALLY?
I'M SO SORRY.

00:20:27.028 --> 00:20:28.613
IT'S MY FAULT WE'RE LATE.

00:20:28.655 --> 00:20:31.825
Sinon: NO, IT'S MINE FOR NOT
KEEPING TRACK OF THE TIME.

00:20:31.867 --> 00:20:33.034
WHATEVER. LET'S HURRY.

00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:36.705
Kirito: WE'RE NEVER
GONNA MAKE IT.

00:20:36.747 --> 00:20:38.623
CAN'T WE JUST TELEPORT
OVER THERE?

00:20:38.665 --> 00:20:41.418
Sinon: I WISH. THAT ONLY
HAPPENS WHEN YOU RESPAWN

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.587
AT A REVIVAL POINT
AFTER YOU DIE.

00:20:43.628 --> 00:20:46.465
AND WE CAN'T SUICIDE OURSELVES
TO GET THERE EITHER,

00:20:46.506 --> 00:20:49.050
'CAUSE IN TOWN,
OUR H. P. NEVER GOES DOWN.

00:20:49.092 --> 00:20:52.304
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS
AT LEAST THREE KILOMETERS AWAY.

00:20:52.345 --> 00:20:54.765
IT'S GONNA TAKE US
FIVE MINUTES TO SIGN UP,

00:20:54.806 --> 00:20:56.975
SO WE HAVE TO GET THERE
IN THREE.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.895
DON'T CLOSE.

00:20:59.936 --> 00:21:01.938
DON'T CLOSE
TILL WE GET THERE.

00:21:06.943 --> 00:21:08.612
Kirito: THAT'S IT.

00:21:14.034 --> 00:21:15.452
HERE WE GO.

00:21:15.494 --> 00:21:16.495
Sinon: (SCREAMS)

00:21:18.121 --> 00:21:19.748
Kirito: BETTER HANG ON!

00:21:26.671 --> 00:21:28.131
Sinon: WAIT A SEC.

00:21:28.173 --> 00:21:30.550
THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
RIDICULOUSLY HARD TO DRIVE.

00:21:30.592 --> 00:21:32.594
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
WHO CAN HANDLE 'EM,

00:21:32.636 --> 00:21:33.887
SO HOW COME YOU CAN?

00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:36.603
Kirito: OH, WELL,
I USED TO PLAY

00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:38.813
A LOT OF RACING GAMES
BACK IN THE DAY.

00:21:42.442 --> 00:21:43.568
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.237
Sinon: (LAUGHS)

00:21:45.278 --> 00:21:46.905
YEAH, I'M FINE.

00:21:46.947 --> 00:21:48.657
THIS IS GREAT.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.534
GO ON. PUNCH IT.

00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:53.495
THE FASTER, THE BETTER.

00:21:53.536 --> 00:21:55.121
Kirito: OKAY.
