IT CAME OUT THAT ANOTHER PERSON
WAS INVOLVED.

THIS THIRD DEATH GUN,
ATSUSHI KANAMOTO,

00:07:38.384 --> 00:07:39.843
IS STILL OUT THERE,

00:07:39.885 --> 00:07:42.638
BUT KIKUOKA SAYS
THEY'LL CATCH HIM SOON ENOUGH.

00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:46.141
THEY GOT THE IDEA OF CREATING

00:07:46.183 --> 00:07:47.476
THE DEATH GUN CHARACTER

00:07:47.518 --> 00:07:49.687
WHEN SHOICHI GOT
THE INVISIBILITY CLOAK

00:07:49.728 --> 00:07:51.772
THROUGH A REAL‐MONEY TRADE.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.900
USING THE CLOAK
AND SOME BINOCULARS,

00:07:54.942 --> 00:07:56.527
SHOICHI STARTED STEALING

00:07:56.568 --> 00:07:59.446
THE REAL‐WORLD INFO
OF THE OTHER PLAYERS.

00:07:59.488 --> 00:08:01.448
MEANWHILE,
HIS LITTLE BROTHER KYOJI

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.159
WAS HAVING ISSUES
WITH HIS AVATAR, SPIEGEL.

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:07.121
XEXEED: THESE PLAYERS WHO THINK

00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:09.289
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THEIR AGILITY‐‐HEH‐‐

00:08:09.331 --> 00:08:11.291
MAN, THEY'RE LIVING IN A DREAM.

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:14.920
Kazuto: SPIEGEL WAS AN AGI‐TYPE,
WHICH XEXEED USED TO RECOMMEND,

00:08:14.962 --> 00:08:18.674
BUT XEXEED SHIFTED HIS STATS
TO A STR‐VIT COMBO,

00:08:18.716 --> 00:08:21.218
AND THAT PISSED KYOJI OFF.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.678
WHEN SHOICHI FOUND OUT,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.014
HE GAVE KYOJI XEXEED's NAME
AND ADDRESS I.R.L.

00:08:26.056 --> 00:08:29.309
THEN THEY STARTED TALKING
ABOUT HOW TO KILL HIM.

00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:32.146
THEY SAY THEY WEREN'T
SERIOUS ABOUT IT AT FIRST,

00:08:32.187 --> 00:08:35.065
BUT DAY AFTER DAY,
THE MORE THEY TALKED ABOUT IT,

00:08:35.107 --> 00:08:38.027
THE MORE IT SEEMED
THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:41.071
FOR THEIR PLAN TO WORK,

00:08:41.113 --> 00:08:43.615
THEY NEEDED TWO THINGS
FROM THEIR DAD'S HOSPITAL,

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:46.577
A MASTER KEY CARD USED
TO OPEN DOORS IN EMERGENCIES

00:08:46.618 --> 00:08:48.954
AND A LETHAL DRUG FOR THE DEED.

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:51.540
THEY RESEARCHED
THEIR VICTIMS CAREFULLY,

00:08:51.582 --> 00:08:54.668
NARROWING THE LIST DOWN
TO THE ONES WHO LIVED ALONE

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.545
IN LOW‐SECURITY APARTMENTS.

00:08:56.587 --> 00:08:58.338
USING THE KEY CARD,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.632
SHOICHI BROKE INTO
THEIR FIRST VICTIM'S PLACE,

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:03.969
SHIGEMURA, A.K.A. XEXEED.

00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:05.387
THE BROTHERS WORKED OUT

00:09:05.429 --> 00:09:07.639
THE EXACT TIME
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE,

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.934
WHEN KYOJI LOGGED IN
AS HIS BROTHER'S AVATAR STERBEN

00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:14.563
AND ANNOUNCED HIMSELF
AS DEATH GUN AND SHOT XEXEED.

00:09:14.605 --> 00:09:17.191
THEIR SECOND VICTIM,
USUSHIO TARAKO,

00:09:17.232 --> 00:09:19.193
WAS KILLED THE SAME WAY.

00:09:19.234 --> 00:09:22.112
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SCARED
OF DEATH GUN,

00:09:22.154 --> 00:09:23.906
THE OTHER PLAYERS IN G.G.O.

00:09:23.947 --> 00:09:26.742
TREATED IT
LIKE SOME KIND OF JOKE.

00:09:26.784 --> 00:09:29.036
Kazuto: SHOICHI AND HIS PARTNERS
WERE FURIOUS,

00:09:29.078 --> 00:09:31.371
SO THEY DECIDED
TO KILL SOME PLAYERS

00:09:31.413 --> 00:09:32.956
DURING THE B.o.B FINAL.

00:09:32.998 --> 00:09:34.958
THEY FOUND THREE

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.753
WHO MET THE SAME CRITERIA
AS XEXEED AND TARAKO‐‐

00:09:37.795 --> 00:09:41.423
PALE RIDER, GARRETT, AND SINON.

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.933
KILLING THREE PEOPLE WAS
GONNA MAKE THINGS HARD

00:09:50.974 --> 00:09:52.768
FOR JUST THE TWO OF THEM,
THOUGH.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.562
Kikuoka: YEAH.
TO BE IN SYNC WITH DEATH GUN,

00:09:55.604 --> 00:09:57.523
THE PERSON DOING
THE REAL‐WORLD KILLING

00:09:57.564 --> 00:10:00.400
HAD TO MAKE SURE THEY'D BE
AT EACH TARGET'S HOUSE ON TIME.

00:10:00.442 --> 00:10:03.195
Kazuto: SO THEY RECRUITED THAT
KANAMOTO GUY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:06.198
TO BE THE THIRD DEATH GUN.
WHERE'D THEY FIND HIM, THOUGH?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.827
Kikuoka: SIMPLE. KANAMOTO WAS
AN OLD FRIEND OF SHOICHI'S.

00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:12.663
THEY WERE BOTH PART
OF LAUGHING COFFIN IN S.A.O.

00:10:12.704 --> 00:10:15.499
WE FOUND OUT HIS HANDLE THERE
WAS JOHNNY BLACK.

00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:16.959
THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:18.919
Kazuto: YEAH.
HE WORKED WITH XAXA.

00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:22.172
I THINK HIS WEAPON OF CHOICE
WAS A POISON KNIFE.

00:10:24.216 --> 00:10:26.969
Kikuoka: THEY PUT KANAMOTO
ON PALE RIDER AND GARRETT,

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.679
'CAUSE HE LIVED NEARBY.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.181
SINON, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WAS KYOJI'S.

00:10:31.223 --> 00:10:34.560
SEE, SHOICHI WAS THE ONE
WHO USUALLY DID THE KILLING,

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:36.145
BUT FOR THIS ONE JOB,

00:10:36.186 --> 00:10:38.647
KYOJI INSISTED ON BEING
THE ONE TO DO IT.

00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:39.857
‐ Shino: UM...
‐ Kikuoka: HMM?

00:10:39.898 --> 00:10:43.360
Shino: IS THAT
WHAT HE WANTED FOR REAL?

00:10:43.402 --> 00:10:45.904
DID SHINKA‐‐
I MEAN KYOJI SAY THAT?

00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:47.698
Kikuoka: NO.
HIS BROTHER WAS THE ONE

00:10:47.739 --> 00:10:50.117
WHO GAVE US
ALL THE DETAILS OF THEIR PLAN.

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:51.827
KYOJI STILL REFUSES TO TALK.

00:10:51.869 --> 00:10:53.370
Shino: HE DOES, HUH?

00:10:54.371 --> 00:10:55.789
Kikuoka: SPEAKING OF,

00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:57.958
WE FOUND OUT
A LITTLE MORE ABOUT SHOICHI.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.294
HEALTHWISE, HE'D BEEN
SICKLY SINCE CHILDHOOD.

00:11:00.335 --> 00:11:02.963
HIS FATHER PRETTY MUCH
GAVE UP ON HIM,

00:11:03.005 --> 00:11:04.423
SO HE DECIDED EARLY ON

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:06.258
TO HAND THE HOSPITAL OVER
TO KYOJI.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.136
Kyoji: STAYING SHARP, MA'AM,
LOCKED AND LOADED.

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:14.224
Kikuoka: EVEN SO, THE BROTHERS
SEEMED TO BE CLOSE GROWING UP,

00:11:14.266 --> 00:11:17.436
BUT THEN SHOICHI
GOT OBSESSED WITH MMORPGs,

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:22.191
AND IN 2022, HE GOT TRAPPED
IN SWORD ART ONLINE.

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:25.152
AFTER HE GOT OUT,

00:11:25.194 --> 00:11:27.362
SHOICHI ONLY SPOKE
TO KYOJI ABOUT IT.

00:11:27.404 --> 00:11:29.531
HE BRAGGED ABOUT HOW,
IN THAT WORLD,

00:11:29.573 --> 00:11:32.576
HE WAS A REAL MASS MURDERER
AND HOW HE WAS FEARED.

00:11:32.618 --> 00:11:36.538
IN KYOJI'S EYES,
HIS BIG BROTHER WAS A HERO.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.041
AS FOR SHOICHI,
HE'S STICKING WITH THE STORY

00:11:39.082 --> 00:11:41.126
THAT EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE DEATH GUN CONCEPT,

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:43.712
INCLUDING THE MURDERS,
WAS JUST PART OF A GAME,

00:11:43.754 --> 00:11:45.339
THAT HIS ACTIONS HERE,

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.091
LIKE GATHERING INTEL ON VICTIMS,
PREPPING FOR THE MURDERS,

00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:50.969
AND COMMITTING THEM, WERE
NO DIFFERENT THAN IN S.A.O.

00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:53.555
Kazuto: THE DARK SIDE OF VRMMOs,

00:11:53.597 --> 00:11:55.098
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.851
HIS REALITY GOT A LOT LESS REAL.

00:11:57.893 --> 00:12:00.437
Kikuoka: YEAH. GOOD POINT.

00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:03.565
AND HOW ARE YOU HANDLING YOURS?

00:12:03.607 --> 00:12:07.694
Kazuto: I FEEL LIKE I LEFT
A PART OF ME BACK IN S.A.O.,

00:12:07.736 --> 00:12:11.531
SO RIGHT NOW, THERE'S LESS OF ME
HERE THAN THERE WAS BEFORE.

00:12:11.573 --> 00:12:12.532
I DON'T KNOW.

00:12:12.574 --> 00:12:13.617
Kikuoka: YOU DON'T KNOW?

00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:14.993
DO YOU WANNA GO BACK?

00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:17.746
Kazuto: SERIOUSLY?
HOW COULD YOU ASK ME THAT?

00:12:17.788 --> 00:12:19.498
Shino: UM, WAIT A SEC.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:22.084
YOU'RE KIND OF CONTRADICTING
WHAT YOU TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY.

00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:23.377
Kazuto: WHAT?

00:12:23.418 --> 00:12:25.545
Shino: YOU SAID
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

00:12:25.587 --> 00:12:27.214
AS A VIRTUAL WORLD, REMEMBER?

00:12:27.256 --> 00:12:30.050
THAT, LIKE, WHEREVER YOU WERE,
THAT'S YOUR REALITY.

00:12:30.092 --> 00:12:32.094
WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW, HERE,

00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:35.973
THIS WORLD IS MY REALITY.

00:12:36.014 --> 00:12:38.892
AND EVEN IF YOU TOLD ME
THIS WAS A VIRTUAL WORLD,

00:12:38.934 --> 00:12:41.019
IT WOULD STILL BE REALITY TO ME.

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:42.521
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

00:12:43.522 --> 00:12:45.232
Kazuto: I GUESS.

00:12:45.274 --> 00:12:47.067
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:12:47.109 --> 00:12:48.860
I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU, SINON.

00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:50.529
WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.198
MIGHT BE THE ONLY GOOD THING
TO COME OUT OF THIS NIGHTMARE.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.658
Shino: OH, PUT A SOCK IN IT.

00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:58.745
Kikuoka: SORRY,
I'M WITH KIRITO ON THIS ONE.

00:12:59.788 --> 00:13:01.290
WELL, I TOLD YOU PRETTY MUCH

00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:02.958
ALL WE'VE FOUND OUT SO FAR.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.793
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
BEFORE I GO?

00:13:04.835 --> 00:13:07.129
Shino: I DO.
HAS THERE BEEN ANY WORD

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.214
ON WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO KYOJI YET?

00:13:11.549 --> 00:13:13.968
Kikuoka: BASED ON HIS BROTHER'S
CONFESSION AND THEIR BEHAVIOR,

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.056
THEY'LL MOST LIKELY BE SENT
TO A MEDICAL DETENTION CENTER.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:21.518
I DOUBT EITHER ONE KNOWS
WHAT REALITY IS ANYMORE.

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:23.269
Shino: NO,
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:24.938
Kikuoka: HMM?

00:13:24.979 --> 00:13:27.357
Shino: I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT KYOJI'S BROTHER.

00:13:27.398 --> 00:13:28.525
I NEVER MET HIM.

00:13:28.566 --> 00:13:30.693
BUT I'VE KNOWN KYOJI
A LONG TIME,

00:13:30.735 --> 00:13:33.947
AND, WELL, I THINK HIS REALITY
WAS GUN GALE ONLINE.

00:13:33.988 --> 00:13:37.784
HE HAD PRETTY MUCH GIVEN UP
ON THIS WORLD.

00:13:37.825 --> 00:13:40.995
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HIM
OTHER THAN G.G.O.,

00:13:41.037 --> 00:13:43.122
SO HE MADE THAT HIS REALITY.

00:13:43.164 --> 00:13:46.042
HE'D SPEND HOURS IN IT
GRINDING AWAY,

00:13:46.084 --> 00:13:49.087
BOOSTING HIS XP,
AND TRYING TO BE THE BEST.

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:52.257
I GUESS THE STRESS
GOT TO BE TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:53.967
Kikuoka: FROM PLAYING A GAME?

00:13:54.008 --> 00:13:56.886
I KNOW YOU CAN LOSE TRACK
OF TIME, BUT REALITY?

00:13:56.928 --> 00:13:58.846
Shino: SURE. AT SOME POINT,

00:13:58.888 --> 00:14:01.516
KYOJI JUST SWAPPED OUT
ONE FOR THE OTHER,

00:14:01.558 --> 00:14:04.143
HIS REAL LIFE
FOR HIS VIRTUAL ONE.

00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:06.396
Kikuoka: OKAY, BUT WHY?

00:14:06.437 --> 00:14:07.730
Shino: I DON'T KNOW,

00:14:07.772 --> 00:14:09.899
BUT I WISH I DID.

00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:13.361
KIRITO, WHY DO YOU
THINK HE DID IT?

00:14:13.403 --> 00:14:15.446
Kazuto: TO GET STRONGER.

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:17.657
Shino: YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:19.367
I GUESS I WAS THE SAME WAY.

00:14:19.409 --> 00:14:21.536
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

00:14:21.578 --> 00:14:24.372
MAYBE ALL US VRMMO PLAYERS
ARE THE SAME.

00:14:24.414 --> 00:14:27.083
ALL WE WANT IS TO GET STRONGER.

00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:29.377
MR. KIKUOKA,

00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:32.130
I'D LIKE TO GO SEE HIM
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:34.048
THERE'S SO MUCH
I WANT TO TELL HIM,

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.800
LIKE WHAT WE WERE
JUST TALKING ABOUT

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:38.678
AND OTHER STUFF I'VE
BEEN THINKING, IF IT'S OKAY.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.472
Kikuoka: MM. YOU'RE
A STRONG PERSON TO WANT TO,

00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:44.350
AND I, FOR ONE,
THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:14:44.392 --> 00:14:45.935
HE CAN'T HAVE VISITORS YET,

00:14:45.977 --> 00:14:48.354
BUT WHEN HE CAN,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

00:14:48.396 --> 00:14:51.858
WELL, I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE NOW.

00:14:51.899 --> 00:14:54.402
Kazuto: OKAY.
THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME.

00:14:54.444 --> 00:14:56.988
Shino: YES, THANK YOU
FOR TALKING TO US.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.531
Kikuoka: DON'T EVEN MENTION IT.

00:14:58.573 --> 00:15:00.074
YOU GUYS RISKED YOUR LIVES,

00:15:00.116 --> 00:15:01.868
AND GOD KNOWS
HOW MANY YOU SAVED.

00:15:01.909 --> 00:15:03.328
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.

00:15:04.495 --> 00:15:06.789
OH, BY THE WAY, KIRITO,

00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:10.168
DEATH GUN OR SHOICHI SHINKAWA
OR RED‐EYED XAXA

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:13.296
OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL HIM
ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU A MESSAGE.

00:15:13.338 --> 00:15:15.381
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT,

00:15:15.423 --> 00:15:17.800
SAY THE WORD,
AND I'LL TEAR IT UP.

00:15:20.303 --> 00:15:21.596
Kazuto: I'LL HEAR IT.

00:15:21.638 --> 00:15:22.972
Kikuoka: YOU GOT IT.

00:15:23.973 --> 00:15:25.433
HE WROTE,

00:15:25.475 --> 00:15:27.852
"IF YOU THINK THIS IS OVER,
IT'S NOT.

00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:30.480
YOU DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO END THIS.

00:15:30.521 --> 00:15:32.273
SOONER OR LATER,
YOU'LL REALIZE THAT.

00:15:32.315 --> 00:15:34.400
IT'S SHOWTIME."

00:15:34.442 --> 00:15:36.194
THAT'S IT.

00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:51.127
Kazuto: HEY, UH, SINON.

00:15:51.169 --> 00:15:53.046
Shino: HMM? WHAT'S UP?

00:15:53.088 --> 00:15:55.590
Kazuto: ARE YOU FREE RIGHT NOW?

00:15:55.632 --> 00:15:58.051
Shino: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "FREE"?

00:15:58.093 --> 00:15:59.552
FREE FOR WHAT?

00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:02.472
(MOTORCYCLE REVS)

00:16:05.975 --> 00:16:09.646
SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU'RE TAKING ME?

00:16:09.688 --> 00:16:12.273
Kazuto: YEP. THERE'S SOMEONE
INSIDE I WANT YOU TO MEET.

00:16:14.109 --> 00:16:15.735
Rika: WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

00:16:15.777 --> 00:16:17.445
YOU MADE US WAIT SO DARN LONG,

00:16:17.487 --> 00:16:19.447
I WENT AND HAD
TWO SLICES OF APPLE PIE.

00:16:19.489 --> 00:16:22.117
IF I GET FAT,
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

00:16:22.158 --> 00:16:24.411
Kazuto: HOW'S THAT
MY FAULT? JEEZ.

00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:27.080
Asuna: COME ON, KIRITO.

00:16:27.122 --> 00:16:28.916
ARE YOU GONNA INTRODUCE US
OR WHAT?

00:16:28.957 --> 00:16:31.648
Kazuto: HUH? OH, RIGHT. SORRY.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.276
THIS IS SHINO ASADA,
A.K.A. SINON,

00:16:34.318 --> 00:16:36.778
GUN GALE ONLINE'S
THIRD SUPER‐CHAMP.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.405
Shino: OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

00:16:38.447 --> 00:16:39.615
Rika: (GROANS)

00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:41.275
Kazuto: (CLEARS THROAT)

00:16:41.317 --> 00:16:44.445
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS
FROM MY TIME IN S.A.O.,

00:16:44.486 --> 00:16:47.406
RIKA, A.K.A. LIZ,
BLACKSMITH AND SWINDLER.

00:16:47.448 --> 00:16:49.992
Rika: HUH?
WHAT THE HELL'D YOU CALL ME?

00:16:50.034 --> 00:16:51.535
HAH! (GROANS)

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:53.537
Kazuto: AND THAT'S ASUNA,
THE BERSERK HEALER,

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.414
REAL NAME ASUNA YUUKI.

00:16:55.456 --> 00:16:56.999
Asuna: UH, BERSERK?

00:16:57.041 --> 00:16:58.626
‐ Rika: (GROANS)
‐ Shino: UH...

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:01.462
Kazuto: YOU WANNA GRAB A SEAT
AND GET SOMETHING TO DRINK?

00:17:02.505 --> 00:17:05.716
Shino: THAT'S WHAT STER‐‐
I MEAN SCHTERBEN MEANS,

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:09.053
A TERM HOSPITALS USE FOR DEATH.

00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:12.890
WHAT WAS HE THINKING GIVING
HIS AVATAR A NAME LIKE THAT?

00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:15.059
Asuna: IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T TRY TO FIND

00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:17.562
SOME DEEPER MEANING IN THE NAME
HE GAVE HIS AVATAR.

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.230
A LOT OF TIMES, IT BOILS DOWN

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:20.940
TO WHATEVER A PLAYER
THINKS SOUND COOL.

00:17:20.982 --> 00:17:22.525
Rika: OH, THAT EXPLAINS IT.

00:17:22.567 --> 00:17:25.027
THIS WHOLE TIME, I THOUGHT
YOU GAVE YOUR AVATAR YOUR NAME

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.112
'CAUSE YOU LACKED IMAGINATION.

00:17:26.154 --> 00:17:27.530
‐ Asuna: ZIP IT.
‐ Rika: AHH.

00:17:27.572 --> 00:17:30.199
Asuna: I DO SO HAVE IMAGINATION,
LOTS OF IT.

00:17:30.241 --> 00:17:31.409
Rika: OKAY! JEEZ.

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:32.493
‐ Asuna: WHATEVER.
‐ Rika: (GIGGLES)

00:17:32.535 --> 00:17:34.328
Asuna: (CHUCKLES)

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.955
Shino: (SIGHS)

00:17:35.997 --> 00:17:39.167
Rika: SO ANYWAY,
I'M SUPER STOKED YOU'RE HERE.

00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:42.086
IT'S ALWAYS COOL TO MEET
ANOTHER GIRL VRMMO PLAYER.

00:17:42.128 --> 00:17:43.296
Asuna: YOU SAID IT.

00:17:43.337 --> 00:17:45.798
I HOPE WE CAN BE
GREAT FRIENDS, ASADA.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.467
Shino: (GASPS)

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:54.891
Asuna: HMM.

00:17:54.932 --> 00:17:58.478
LISTEN, ASADA, SHINO,

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:01.773
THERE'S ANOTHER REASON FOR US
ASKING YOU TO COME HERE TODAY.

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:03.399
Shino: WHAT IS IT?

00:18:03.441 --> 00:18:05.109
Kazuto: SINON, I'M SORRY

00:18:05.151 --> 00:18:07.653
TO PUT YOU
ON THE SPOT LIKE THIS.

00:18:09.739 --> 00:18:11.991
I, UH‐‐I TOLD ASUNA AND LIZ

00:18:12.033 --> 00:18:14.368
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.953
Shino: (GASPS)

00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:18.331
Kazuto: I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.
I NEEDED THEIR HELP.

00:18:18.372 --> 00:18:19.332
Shino: HUH?

00:18:19.373 --> 00:18:20.333
Asuna: I'LL EXPLAIN.

00:18:20.374 --> 00:18:21.876
WE WANTED TO HELP YOU,

00:18:21.918 --> 00:18:24.921
SO WE PAID A VISIT TO THE TOWN
WHERE YOU USED TO LIVE.

00:18:24.962 --> 00:18:26.130
Shino: (GASPS)

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:27.507
HOW COULD YOU?

00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:29.383
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

00:18:31.803 --> 00:18:33.387
Kazuto: WAIT, SINON.

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:35.431
THEY FOUND SOMEONE
WHO WANTS TO MEET YOU.

00:18:35.473 --> 00:18:38.768
I CAN'T LET YOU LEAVE TILL YOU
HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.980
IT MIGHT HURT, AND I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T STAND BY

00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:45.733
IF THERE'S A CHANCE
WHAT THEY SAY HELPS.

00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:47.568
Shino: WHO IS THIS PERSON?

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.738
WHAT DO THEY WANT TO TELL ME?

00:19:10.633 --> 00:19:13.177
SORRY. DO I KNOW YOU?

00:19:14.428 --> 00:19:16.389
Sachie: SACHIE OOSAWA.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.891
YOU'RE SHINO ASADA, AREN'T YOU?

00:19:18.933 --> 00:19:21.686
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY DAUGHTER.

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:24.605
HER NAME'S MIZUEH.
SHE'S FOUR YEARS OLD.

00:19:26.107 --> 00:19:27.817
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER,

00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:30.486
BUT I USED TO WORK
AT THE POST OFFICE.

00:19:30.528 --> 00:19:31.946
Shino: (GASPS)

00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:35.241
Sachie: (GASPS)

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.287
Shino: (GASPS)

00:19:39.328 --> 00:19:41.622
Sachie: I'M SORRY.

00:19:41.664 --> 00:19:43.916
THIS IS REALLY HARD.

00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.334
SEE, I‐‐

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.629
I SHOULD HAVE
DONE THIS AGES AGO.

00:19:48.671 --> 00:19:51.382
I'M SO SORRY IT TOOK THIS LONG.

00:19:51.424 --> 00:19:54.886
I NEVER APOLOGIZED
OR THANKED YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.351
I WAS PREGNANT WITH HER

00:20:02.393 --> 00:20:04.896
THE DAY THAT MAN CAME IN
AND TRIED TO ROB US.

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:09.317
WHAT YOU DID, IT WASN'T
JUST MY LIFE YOU SAVED.

00:20:09.358 --> 00:20:12.486
YOU SAVED THE LIFE
OF MY LITTLE GIRL, TOO.

00:20:12.528 --> 00:20:14.030
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:17.867
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU,
SHE WOULDN'T BE HERE.

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:21.287
Shino: I SAVED YOUR DAUGHTER?

00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:24.832
Kazuto: SINON, TIME TO LET GO.

00:20:24.874 --> 00:20:26.918
YOU'VE BEEN BLAMING YOURSELF
WAY TOO LONG,

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:29.045
BEATING YOURSELF UP
OVER WHAT HAPPENED.

00:20:29.086 --> 00:20:32.089
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE
WRONG TO DO THAT, BUT...

00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:35.134
(INHALES)

00:20:35.176 --> 00:20:38.679
IT'S JUST WHATEVER GUILT
YOU FEEL ABOUT WHAT YOU DID,

00:20:38.721 --> 00:20:41.933
YOU GOT A RIGHT TO CONSIDER
THE LIVES YOU SAVED, TOO.

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:45.770
YOU GOT THE RIGHT
TO THINK ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:48.397
AND FORGIVE YOURSELF.
THAT'S IT.

00:20:48.439 --> 00:20:50.858
THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW.

00:20:52.026 --> 00:20:53.277
(STOOL THUMPS)

00:21:11.796 --> 00:21:13.506
Mizueh: I MADE IT FOR YOU.

00:21:13.547 --> 00:21:15.841
THANK YOU FOR SAVING MOMMY

00:21:15.883 --> 00:21:18.177
AND FOR SAVING ME.

00:21:18.219 --> 00:21:20.513
WE LOVE YOU. (GIGGLES)

00:21:46.414 --> 00:21:47.623
