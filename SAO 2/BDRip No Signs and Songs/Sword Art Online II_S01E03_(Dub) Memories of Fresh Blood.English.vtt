WEBVTT

00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.685
(SCHOOL BELL CHIMING)

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:23.421
Girl: ASADA!

00:00:23.463 --> 00:00:26.091
SHINO ASADA!

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.782
Shopgirl: ALL YOUR FAVORITES
ARE IN STOCK RIGHT NOW.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.744
Girl 2: MOVE.

00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:10.663
GO ON.
QUIT DRAGGIN' YOUR FEET!

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:12.957
Endou: I NEED A FAVOR.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.043
WE SORTA WENT
OVER‐TIME AT KARAOKE,

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:17.545
AND NOW WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH CASH FOR THE TRAIN HOME.

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:19.213
WE'RE GONNA NEED ABOUT TEN.

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:20.381
WE'LL PAY YOU BACK, THOUGH.

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:21.924
Shino: TEN THOUSAND?

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:24.260
I DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH MONEY ON ME.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.972
Endou: WELL,
GO WITHDRAW IT THEN.

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.018
Shino: NO.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.061
Endou: HUH?

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:35.938
Shino: YOU HEARD. I SAID NO.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.025
I'M NOT GIVING YOU GUYS
ANY MONEY.

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:40.943
Endou: YOU BITCH.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.613
WE'LL DO THIS THE HARD WAY.

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:46.157
Shino: GET OUT OF THE WAY.
I WANNA GO.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.325
Endou: (LAUGHS)

00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:54.665
Shino: (GASPS)

00:03:01.672 --> 00:03:03.591
(WHIMPERING)

00:03:08.012 --> 00:03:10.181
Endou: BANG.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:14.519
(CHUCKLES) POOR ASADA.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.270
Y'KNOW MY BIG BROTHER?

00:03:16.312 --> 00:03:18.898
WELL, HE'S GOT A BUTT‐LOAD
OF THESE MODEL GUNS.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.526
WOULDN'T IT BE COOL
IF I BROUGHT SOME TO CLASS?

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:23.653
I KNOW YOU LIKE GUNS,

00:03:23.694 --> 00:03:26.113
ESPECIALLY PISTOLS.

00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:31.786
Girl 2: UH‐OH.
SOMEONE'S GONNA HURL.

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:35.456
Girl 1: REMEMBER WHEN YOU BLEW
CHUNKS IN CLASS AND FAINTED?

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:38.543
OH, GOD, THAT STANK
LIKE ASS FOR DAYS.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.795
Endou: ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS GIVE US YOUR MONEY,

00:03:40.837 --> 00:03:42.213
AND WE'LL LET YOU GO HOME.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:45.007
DON'T YA WANNA?
I MEAN, YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:47.885
Kyoji: OFFICER!

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:51.347
A GIRL'S GETTING MUGGED
IN THE ALLEY! HURRY!

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.642
Endou: BITCH!

00:03:55.643 --> 00:03:57.645
Shino: (PANTING)

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:05.820
Kyoji: ASADA.

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:07.238
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:04:12.243 --> 00:04:15.163
Shino: YEAH,
I'M FINE, SHINKAWA.

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:16.956
THANKS FOR THAT.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.673
Kyoji: SO I HEARD
WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY.

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:27.592
YOU WENT ON QUITE THE RAMPAGE.

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:30.511
Shino: YEAH, BUT FOR
A STRATEGY, IT WAS A FAIL.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:32.680
I MEAN,
WE STARTED THE OP WITH SIX

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:34.724
AND LOST FOUR
BY THE END OF IT.

00:04:34.765 --> 00:04:37.226
IF THAT'S THE OUTCOME
OF AN AMBUSH WE SET UP,

00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:39.061
IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A WIN, Y'KNOW?

00:04:39.103 --> 00:04:40.813
Kyoji: YOU WERE PRETTY RAD,
THOUGH.

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:42.732
Y'KNOW THAT BEHEMOTH GUY
WITH THE MINIGUN?

00:04:42.773 --> 00:04:44.692
HE WAS KIND OF A LEGEND
IN THE GAME,

00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:46.986
'CAUSE HE NEVER BOUGHT IT
IN A SQUAD FIGHT BEFORE.

00:04:47.028 --> 00:04:48.070
Shino: YEAH?

00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:50.239
I HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS THAT GOOD.

00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:54.202
I NEVER REALLY SAW
HIS RANKINGS IN B.o.B.

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:55.578
Kyoji: HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.955
I MEAN, NO MATTER
HOW POWERFUL A MINIGUN IS,

00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:59.165
CARRYING
FIVE HUNDRED ROUNDS OF AMMO

00:04:59.207 --> 00:05:00.541
PUSHES YOU
OVER THE WEIGHT LIMIT,

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:02.084
SO YOU CAN'T RUN.

00:05:02.126 --> 00:05:04.170
AND SINCE B.o.B.'s
A SOLO ENCOUNTER BATTLE,

00:05:04.212 --> 00:05:06.923
HE WAS EASY PICKINGS
FOR A SNIPER LIKE YOU.

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:11.344
STILL, WITH THAT GUN,
HE'S PRETTY MUCH INVINCIBLE

00:05:11.385 --> 00:05:13.804
AS LONG AS HE'S
WITH A GOOD SQUAD.

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.389
THE MINIGUN
SHOULD BE BANNED

00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:18.226
Shino: IF WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT BANNING WEAPONS,

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:21.354
DON'T FORGET SOME PEOPLE THINK
MY HECATE'S A CHEAT, TOO.

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:23.648
AS ITS OWNER, I HAVE TO ADMIT

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:26.317
USING IT DOES HAVE
ITS OWN SPECIAL PROBLEMS.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:29.403
Kyoji: (SIGHS) WISH I HAD
PROBLEMS LIKE THAT.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:34.408
SO WHAT'RE YOUR PLANS
FOR THE NEXT B.o.B.?

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.619
Shino:
I'M DEFINITELY ENTERING.

00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:38.871
I DID MY HOMEWORK
AND HAVE MOST OF THE INFO

00:05:38.913 --> 00:05:41.165
OF THE TOP TWENTY PLAYERS
FROM THE LAST ONE,

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:42.750
AND I'VE GOT MY HECATE NOW.

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:45.253
WITH HER IN MY HANDS,
I'M SURE I CAN KI‐‐

00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:48.714
I‐I MEAN
CRACK THE HIGHER RANKS.

00:05:48.756 --> 00:05:51.968
(THINKING) IF I CAN
TAKE OUT ALL MY ENEMIES

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.846
AND PROVE I'M THE STRONGEST,
I'LL BE FREE.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.683
Kyoji: MAN...

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:00.685
ASADA, YOU'RE AMAZING.

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:03.020
HAVING THAT AWESOME GUN
IS ONE THING,

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:05.648
BUT YOU WERE ALSO SMART ENOUGH
TO PUT YOUR POINTS

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.150
ON STRENGTH STATS
SO YOU COULD USE IT.

00:06:08.192 --> 00:06:10.444
I'M THE ONE
WHO GOT YOU INTO G.G.O.,

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:12.363
BUT I'VE BEEN
TOTALLY LEFT BEHIND.

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.156
Shino: THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

00:06:14.198 --> 00:06:15.658
IN THE LAST QUALIFIER,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.703
YOU MADE IT ALL THE WAY
TO THE SEMIFINALS, REMEMBER?

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:20.496
Kyoji: EH. WHATEVER.

00:06:20.538 --> 00:06:23.624
AN AGI BUILD ONLY GETS YOU
SO FAR IN G.G.O.

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:25.376
A GOOD GUN HELPS, TOO.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:27.545
I SPENT POINTS
ON THE WRONG STAT.

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:29.880
Shino: DON'T GET SO DOWN
ABOUT THAT STUFF.

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:32.216
SIGN UP FOR B.o.B.,
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:34.093
Kyoji: NAH. NO POINT.

00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:35.303
I'D JUST DIE.

00:06:35.344 --> 00:06:37.513
Shino: OH. HMM.

00:06:37.555 --> 00:06:39.515
HEY, HOW'RE YOUR STUDIES
COMING ALONG?

00:06:39.557 --> 00:06:41.517
YOU STILL WANNA BE A DOCTOR?

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:43.978
Kyoji: YEAH. IT IS
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.355
I PROMISED MY DAD
I'D GO TO MED SCHOOL,

00:06:46.397 --> 00:06:48.983
SO IT'S A DONE DEAL.
STUCK WITH IT NOW.

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:52.111
Shino: WELL, WHAT ABOUT
CRAM SCHOOL AND THE G.E.D.?

00:06:52.153 --> 00:06:53.988
ARE THOSE GOING OKAY?

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.532
Kyoji: OH, YEAH.
IT'S GOIN' GREAT.

00:06:56.574 --> 00:06:59.910
I'M MAINTAINING THE SAME RANK
I HAD WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL.

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:02.246
STAYIN' SHARP, MA'AM.
LOCKED AND LOADED.

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:04.999
Shino: ROGER THAT.
(LAUGHING)

00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:06.792
Kyoji: (LAUGHING)

00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:08.335
Shino: THE REASON I ASKED,

00:07:08.377 --> 00:07:10.379
IS 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
ONLINE WHEN I LOG ON.

00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:12.298
THAT'S WHY I WAS
A LITTLE WORRIED.

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.800
IF YOU'RE ONLINE THAT MUCH,
WHEN DO YOU STUDY?

00:07:14.842 --> 00:07:17.053
Kyoji: I DO MOST OF MY STUDYING
DURING THE DAY,

00:07:17.094 --> 00:07:19.055
AND I TAKE LOTS OF BREAKS, TOO.

00:07:19.096 --> 00:07:20.848
Shino: YOU MUST BE
MAKING TONS OF CASH

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.641
IF YOU'RE DIVING
ALL THE TIME LIKE THAT.

00:07:22.683 --> 00:07:24.685
Kyoji: I'M NOT MAKING THAT MUCH.

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:28.189
SOLO HUNTING'S IMPOSSIBLE
FOR AGI BUILDS THESE DAYS.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.649
Shino: OH. WELL,
YOU'RE DOING GREAT

00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:33.861
IF YOU'RE EARNING ENOUGH
FOR THE CONNECTION FEE.

00:07:33.903 --> 00:07:35.821
UH‐OH, IT'S LATE.

00:07:35.863 --> 00:07:38.699
SORRY. I HAVE TO GET GOING NOW.

00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:41.535
Kyoji: OH. OKAY. HEY, UH...

00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:43.579
ARE YOU STILL MAKIN' DINNER
FOR YOURSELF?

00:07:43.621 --> 00:07:46.165
I'D LOVE TO TRY MORE
OF YOUR COOKING SOMEDAY.

00:07:46.207 --> 00:07:49.710
Shino: HUH? OH, SURE.
OKAY.

00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:53.255
IT'S JUST I THINK I NEED
TO GET BETTER AT IT FIRST.

00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:56.050
THANKS FOR THE TEA.

00:07:56.092 --> 00:08:00.096
AND THANKS‐‐I MEAN,
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME.

00:08:00.137 --> 00:08:01.889
YOU WERE PRETTY COOL.

00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:06.060
Kyoji: I WISH I COULD ALWAYS
BE THERE TO PROTECT YOU.

00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:07.770
HEY, UH, IF YOU WANT,

00:08:07.812 --> 00:08:10.106
I CAN WALK YOU HOME
EVERY DAY.

00:08:10.147 --> 00:08:11.899
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT.

00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:13.234
Shino: OH, NO, NO.

00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:14.401
THAT'S OKAY.

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:15.778
I'LL BE FINE.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.822
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'LL GET STRONGER.

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:39.595
WHAT A DAY.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.997
I CAN DO THIS.

00:09:14.547 --> 00:09:17.258
(NERVOUS BREATHING)

00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:34.317
(HEART BEATING)

00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:48.831
(SCREAMS)

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.878
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT DAD LOOKED LIKE.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.423
I REMEMBER HEARING HE DIED
IN A CAR ACCIDENT, THOUGH,

00:09:57.465 --> 00:10:00.259
SOMETIME BEFORE I TURNED TWO.

00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:03.262
AFTER THE ACCIDENT,
MY MOM AND I LEFT TOKYO.

00:10:03.304 --> 00:10:05.932
WE WENT TO GO LIVE
WITH HER PARENTS.

00:10:05.973 --> 00:10:09.227
IT WAS PEACEFUL THERE
FOR BOTH OF US.

00:10:11.354 --> 00:10:13.397
Ms. Asada: (CHUCKLES)

00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:21.405
Young Shino: HUH?

00:10:21.447 --> 00:10:22.907
Shino: AND THEN ONE DAY,

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:26.285
THAT PEACE WAS SHATTERED.

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:33.834
Robber: (GRUNTS)

00:10:38.714 --> 00:10:40.841
PUT THE MONEY IN THE BAG,
GOD DAMN IT!

00:10:40.883 --> 00:10:42.593
AND DON'T HIT THE ALARM,
OR ELSE!

00:10:42.635 --> 00:10:43.970
Young Shino: MOMMY!

00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.846
Robber: C'MON!
DON'T JUST STAND THERE!

00:10:45.888 --> 00:10:47.348
START FILLIN' IT UP!

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.808
LET'S GO! MOVE IT!

00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:50.309
Clerk: OKAY, SURE.

00:10:53.813 --> 00:10:55.231
(GUNSHOT)

00:11:03.155 --> 00:11:06.576
Robber: I TOLD HIM NOT TO!
YOU HEARD ME!

00:11:06.617 --> 00:11:08.119
LET'S GO, BITCH!

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.496
FILL IT UP,
OR YOU GET IT, TOO!

00:11:12.456 --> 00:11:13.833
GIMME THE MONEY NOW,

00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:15.334
OR I'M GONNA KILL HER NEXT!

00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:17.295
I SWEAR I'LL DO IT!

00:11:18.963 --> 00:11:20.673
(SCREAMS)

00:11:29.348 --> 00:11:31.183
YOU LITTLE...

00:11:31.225 --> 00:11:33.853
GIVE IT BACK, YOU BRAT! LET GO!

00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:35.938
LET GO OF MY GUN!

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.108
(GUNSHOT)

00:11:46.032 --> 00:11:48.826
(SCREAMS)

00:12:43.673 --> 00:12:46.801
Shino: (SCREAMING)

00:12:58.938 --> 00:13:02.525
Robber: (LAUGHS)

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.822
(RUNNING FOOTSTEPS)

00:13:09.782 --> 00:13:11.367
Shino: (VOMITS)

00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:13.244
(COUGHING)

00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:14.704
(VOMITS)

00:13:17.456 --> 00:13:19.709
(TOILET FLUSHING)

00:13:39.687 --> 00:13:41.647
I LOOK AWFUL

00:13:50.906 --> 00:13:53.576
SOMEBODY...

00:13:53.617 --> 00:13:57.371
ANYBODY SAVE ME.

00:14:07.132 --> 00:14:09.885
Asuna: WAIT! WHAT?!
Y‐YOU'RE KIDDING!

00:14:09.927 --> 00:14:11.345
YOU'RE QUITTING A.L.O.?!

00:14:12.471 --> 00:14:13.764
Kirito: N‐NO!

00:14:13.806 --> 00:14:15.599
I'LL JUST BE GONE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:17.935
I'LL CONVERT BACK AFTER THAT.

00:14:17.977 --> 00:14:20.020
Asuna: BUT WHY?

00:14:20.062 --> 00:14:22.064
Kirito: WELL, ACTUALLY...

00:14:22.106 --> 00:14:23.732
IT'S COMPLICATED.

00:14:23.774 --> 00:14:27.569
THERE'S THIS OTHER VIRTUAL MMO
THAT I NEED TO CHECK OUT.

00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:29.196
Asuna: "NEED TO," HUH?

00:14:29.238 --> 00:14:31.782
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE
AND JUST USED NEW ACCOUNTS.

00:14:31.824 --> 00:14:33.534
WHY NOT FOR THIS ONE, TOO?

00:14:33.575 --> 00:14:36.620
I MEAN, IF YOU CONVERT,
YOUR ITEMS WILL BE RESET.

00:14:36.662 --> 00:14:38.956
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

00:14:38.998 --> 00:14:41.166
Kirito:
WELL, IT'S LIKE A FAVOR

00:14:41.208 --> 00:14:43.419
FOR THAT GUY
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

00:14:50.551 --> 00:14:52.928
Asuna: I GUESS IF MR. KIKUOKA'S
ASKING YOU TO,

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.513
YOU CAN'T SAY NO.

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:56.890
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS ABOUT THAT MAN,

00:14:56.932 --> 00:14:58.308
BUT THERE'S A PART OF ME

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.811
THAT STILL HAS
A HARD TIME TRUSTING HIM.

00:15:00.853 --> 00:15:03.981
Kirito: YEAH. I'M NOT TOO SURE
I CAN TRUST HIM, EITHER.

00:15:05.232 --> 00:15:08.068
Asuna: JUST GET BACK
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.403
THIS IS OUR HOME,

00:15:09.445 --> 00:15:11.697
AND IT'S NOT THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU.

00:15:12.698 --> 00:15:14.575
(GEAR CLANKING)

00:15:21.457 --> 00:15:22.833
Kirito: DON'T WORRY.

00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:25.127
I'LL BE BACK IN A.L.O.
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

00:15:25.169 --> 00:15:27.046
I'LL JUST DIVE
INTO GUN GALE ONLINE

00:15:27.087 --> 00:15:29.339
FOR A COUPLE DAYS,
SEE WHAT'S GOIN' ON,

00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:30.382
AND THAT'S THAT.

00:15:31.884 --> 00:15:33.886
I'M NINETY‐NINE PERCENT SURE

00:15:33.927 --> 00:15:35.888
THE DEATH GUN STORY'S A HOAX,

00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:37.306
PROBABLY SOMEONE TROLLING.

00:15:37.347 --> 00:15:39.224
YOU CAN'T KILL SOMEONE

00:15:39.266 --> 00:15:41.810
IN THE REAL WORLD
FROM THE VIRTUAL ANYMORE.

00:15:41.852 --> 00:15:44.271
I KNOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:15:44.313 --> 00:15:46.398
Death Gun:
THIS IS REAL POWER,

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.233
REAL STRENGTH!

00:15:48.275 --> 00:15:52.279
LET YOUR FEAR CARVE ONE NAME
INTO YOUR BRAINS,

00:15:52.321 --> 00:15:54.740
THE NAME I SHARE
WITH THIS WEAPON,

00:15:54.782 --> 00:15:56.700
DEATH GUN!

00:15:58.368 --> 00:16:00.037
Kazuto: BUT THERE'S STILL

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:02.831
THAT ONE PERCENT CHANCE
IT COULD BE TRUE.

00:16:02.873 --> 00:16:05.334
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:16:13.092 --> 00:16:14.635
HELLO. ANYONE HERE?

00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:15.886
Aki: YEP!

00:16:15.928 --> 00:16:18.597
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, KIRIGAYA?

00:16:20.682 --> 00:16:22.351
Kazuto: MS. AKI.

00:16:22.392 --> 00:16:24.561
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:26.939
(GASPS)

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.065
Aki: WHOA!

00:16:28.107 --> 00:16:29.858
YOU FINALLY
GOT SOME MEAT ON YOU.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.735
YOU COULD USE SOME FILLING OUT,
THOUGH.

00:16:31.777 --> 00:16:33.112
YOU SURE YOU'RE EATING RIGHT?

00:16:33.153 --> 00:16:35.072
Kazuto: YEAH, I'M EATING.
I'M EATING.

00:16:35.114 --> 00:16:37.282
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

00:16:37.324 --> 00:16:39.409
Aki: YOUR FRIEND
IN THE SUIT AND GLASSES

00:16:39.451 --> 00:16:41.161
TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR MISSION.

00:16:41.203 --> 00:16:44.248
HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
YOU GOING INTO A VIRTUAL NETWORK

00:16:44.289 --> 00:16:46.458
AND DOING SOME RECONNAISSANCE
OR SOMETHING.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.210
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'D ASK YOU.

00:16:48.252 --> 00:16:50.087
I MEAN, YOU'VE ONLY BEEN
BACK FOR A YEAR.

00:16:50.129 --> 00:16:51.463
ANYWAY, HE FOUND OUT

00:16:51.505 --> 00:16:54.133
I WAS THE ONE
WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF YOUR REHAB,

00:16:54.174 --> 00:16:57.469
SO HE ASKED ME TO KEEP AN EYE
ON YOUR MONITORS WHILE YOU DIVE.

00:16:57.511 --> 00:16:59.555
THEY TOOK ME OFF MY NORMAL SHIFT
AND EVERYTHING.

00:16:59.596 --> 00:17:01.515
THE HEAD NURSE WASN'T HAPPY,

00:17:01.557 --> 00:17:03.016
BUT WHAT CAN SHE DO ABOUT IT?

00:17:03.058 --> 00:17:04.268
IF THE GOVERNMENT
WANTS SOMETHING,

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:05.811
THEY'RE GONNA GET IT.

00:17:05.853 --> 00:17:09.523
WELL, I GUESS YOU AND ME
ARE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, HUH?

00:17:10.732 --> 00:17:12.985
Kazuto: YEAH.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:16.488
UM, SO IT'S JUST US TODAY?
NO KIKUOKA?

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.867
Aki: MM‐HMM. HE ASKED ME
TO GIVE YOU A MESSAGE, THOUGH.

00:17:25.414 --> 00:17:28.625
Kikuoka: EMAIL YOUR REPORTS
TO ME AT THE USUAL ADDRESS.

00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:30.836
YOUR FEE AND EXPENSES
WILL BE PAID

00:17:30.878 --> 00:17:32.463
WHEN YOU FINISH THE MISSION,

00:17:32.504 --> 00:17:34.965
SO PLEASE DON'T FORGET
TO SEND ME AN INVOICE.

00:17:35.007 --> 00:17:38.010
P.S. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALONE
WITH A PRETTY NURSE,

00:17:38.051 --> 00:17:39.595
YOU'RE STILL ON THE CLOCK.

00:17:39.636 --> 00:17:43.182
TRY TO KEEP THOSE HORMONES
OF YOURS UNDER CONTROL.

00:17:46.185 --> 00:17:48.270
Kazuto: UH, IF IT'S OKAY,

00:17:48.312 --> 00:17:50.272
I'D LIKE TO CONNECT
TO THE NETWORK NOW.

00:17:50.314 --> 00:17:53.400
Aki: YEAH, SURE.
IT'S ALL SET UP.

00:17:59.907 --> 00:18:01.867
OKAY, HOT STUFF, STRIP!

00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:03.202
Kazuto: WHY?!

00:18:03.243 --> 00:18:04.953
Aki: FOR THE ELECTRODES.

00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:06.288
OH, DON'T BE SHY.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.499
I'VE SEEN
ALL YOUR GOODIES BEFORE.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.752
Kazuto: UH, ACTUALLY,
CAN I JUST TAKE OFF MY SHIRT?

00:18:13.795 --> 00:18:15.214
Aki: MM‐HMM.

00:18:15.255 --> 00:18:17.174
Kazuto: (SIGHS)

00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:22.554
Aki: THERE.
YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

00:18:27.893 --> 00:18:30.979
Kazuto: WELL, HERE I GO.
WISH ME LUCK.

00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:34.191
I DON'T SEE THIS TAKIN' ME
MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE HOURS.

00:18:34.233 --> 00:18:35.859
Aki: YOU GOT IT.

00:18:35.901 --> 00:18:38.362
AND DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
YOUR BODY WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

00:18:38.403 --> 00:18:40.113
I'LL KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON IT.

00:18:40.155 --> 00:18:42.991
Kazuto: THANKS.
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY

00:18:50.415 --> 00:18:52.000
LINK START!

00:18:58.006 --> 00:18:59.633
Shino: YEAH, I'M DOING GREAT.

00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:01.260
I'M USED TO THE SCHOOL NOW,

00:19:01.301 --> 00:19:03.303
AND I'VE MADE
SOME FRIENDS, TOO.

00:19:04.555 --> 00:19:06.848
I'M FINE, REALLY.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.851
I'VE ONLY HAD A COUPLE
PANIC ATTACKS. THAT'S ALL.

00:19:10.852 --> 00:19:12.813
YEAH, GRANDPA, I WILL.

00:19:12.854 --> 00:19:15.524
DON'T YOU CATCH
ANY COLDS, EITHER.

00:19:15.566 --> 00:19:17.526
I'LL COME HOME
FOR WINTER BREAK.

00:19:17.568 --> 00:19:20.153
ME, TOO. BYE.

00:19:24.825 --> 00:19:26.493
EVER SINCE THAT DAY,

00:19:26.535 --> 00:19:29.162
WHENEVER I SEE A GUN,
I FREAK OUT.

00:19:29.204 --> 00:19:32.624
IF I SEE A PICTURE OF ONE
OR SEE ONE ON TV,

00:19:32.666 --> 00:19:35.127
I'M GUARANTEED A PANIC ATTACK.

00:19:35.168 --> 00:19:37.379
I CAME TO TOKYO
FOR HIGH SCHOOL,

00:19:37.421 --> 00:19:40.924
THINKING IF I GOT FAR ENOUGH
AWAY FROM HOME, IT'D HELP,

00:19:40.966 --> 00:19:42.301
BUT IT DIDN'T.

00:19:46.096 --> 00:19:49.766
ONE DAY, SHINKAWA TOLD ME
ABOUT GUN GALE ONLINE,

00:19:49.808 --> 00:19:53.061
AND I THOUGHT IT COULD WORK
AS A KIND OF THERAPY FOR ME.

00:19:53.103 --> 00:19:55.856
AND IN A WAY, IT WORKED.

00:19:55.897 --> 00:19:58.442
AS SINON,
WHEN I'M HOLDING A GUN

00:19:58.483 --> 00:20:00.402
OR WHEN SOMEONE'S
DRAWING DOWN ON ME,

00:20:00.444 --> 00:20:01.778
I CAN HANDLE IT.

00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:08.035
I FIGURE
THE STRONGER SINON GETS,

00:20:08.076 --> 00:20:10.704
THE STRONGER I'LL GET
IN THE REAL WORLD,

00:20:10.746 --> 00:20:13.540
SO I KEEP FIGHTING
WITH MY HECATE TWO,

00:20:13.582 --> 00:20:16.376
HOPING IT'LL HELP ME
KICK THIS PHOBIA.

00:20:19.254 --> 00:20:22.841
WINNING THE NEXT
BULLET OF BULLETS WILL CURE ME.

00:20:22.883 --> 00:20:25.260
I KNOW IT WILL.

00:20:25.302 --> 00:20:27.554
IT HAS TO.

00:20:27.596 --> 00:20:29.806
LINK START.

00:20:39.858 --> 00:20:42.819
Player 1: ZXE‐D AND TARAKO
HAVEN'T LOGGED ON FOR A WHILE.

00:20:42.861 --> 00:20:44.446
IT'S BEEN, LIKE, A MONTH.

00:20:44.488 --> 00:20:47.199
IF ANYONE'S GOT THEIR
CONTACT INFO IN THE REAL WORLD,

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.992
HOOK US UP WITH IT.

00:20:49.034 --> 00:20:51.453
Player 2: DUDE, IF NO ONE'S
HEARD FROM 'EM THIS LONG,

00:20:51.495 --> 00:20:52.663
THEY'RE GONE FOR GOOD.

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:54.456
Player 3:
WE KNOW THE DATE AND TIME

00:20:54.498 --> 00:20:55.874
THEY WERE SHOT
BY DEATH GUN, THOUGH,

00:20:55.916 --> 00:20:57.626
SO ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS CHECK

00:20:57.668 --> 00:20:59.586
IF ANY VRMMO PLAYERS
DIED AROUND THAT TIME,

00:20:59.628 --> 00:21:01.672
AND WE'LL KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO 'EM.

00:21:01.713 --> 00:21:03.548
Player 1: YEAH,
BUT IF THEY LIVED ALONE,

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.217
MAYBE NO ONE'S FOUND
THEIR BODIES YET.

00:21:05.258 --> 00:21:07.511
WE ALREADY ASKED THE COPS,
BUT THEY'RE NOT TALKING.

00:21:07.552 --> 00:21:09.763
WE EVEN SENT EMAILS TO ZASKAR
ABOUT 'EM,

00:21:09.805 --> 00:21:12.099
BUT ALL THEY SENT BACK
WAS THE OLD,

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.060
"SORRY, WE NEVER SHARE
OUR USERS' PERSONAL INFO" CRAP.

00:21:15.102 --> 00:21:16.395
Player 3:
I HATE TO SAY IT,

00:21:16.436 --> 00:21:18.188
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO BE
SURE THEY WERE KILLED

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.815
IS FOR ONE OF US
TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF.

00:21:19.856 --> 00:21:21.483
SO TOMORROW AT 11:30 P. M.,

00:21:21.525 --> 00:21:24.027
I'M GONNA WAIT FOR DEATH GUN
AT THE GLOCKEN CENTRAL BANK,

00:21:24.069 --> 00:21:25.320
AND JUST SO HE KNOWS IT'S ME,

00:21:25.362 --> 00:21:26.988
I'LL HAVE A RED ROSE
ON MY CHEST.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.491
SHOOT ME, DEATH GUN!
I DARE YOU.

00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:31.243
Player 1: AH, DUDE,
YOU'LL BE A HERO.

00:21:31.284 --> 00:21:33.120
BUT YOU BETTER POST
YOUR REAL NAME AND ADDRESS.

00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:35.247
OTHERWISE, WHAT'S THE POINT?

00:21:35.288 --> 00:21:37.916
Player 2: OH, DO A PUBLIC DIVE
AT AN INTERNET CAFE, MAN!

00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:39.876
Player 1: (LAUGHING) DO IT!

00:21:39.918 --> 00:21:41.086
DO IT!

00:21:41.128 --> 00:21:42.462
Death Gun: WHATEVER.
