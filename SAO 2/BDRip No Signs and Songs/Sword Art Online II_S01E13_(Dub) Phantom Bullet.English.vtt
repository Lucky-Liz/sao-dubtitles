THE SIGNIFICANCE

BY TAKING ON THE PERSON
WHO REPRESENTS THEM, DEATH GUN.

AND THE REASON HE CAN
ISN'T 'CAUSE HE'S STRONG.

IT'S 'CAUSE HE ACCEPTS
WHAT HE DID,

00:13:22.562 --> 00:13:24.231
WHAT AM I DOING?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.737
( SIGHS )

00:13:32.197 --> 00:13:34.282
‐ ( DOORBELL RINGS )
‐ ( GASPS )

00:13:35.408 --> 00:13:36.618
( DOORBELL RINGS )

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.914
( DOORBELL RINGS )

00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:49.381
Kyoji: ASADA? YOU THERE?

00:13:49.422 --> 00:13:51.883
IT'S ME, ASADA.

00:13:51.925 --> 00:13:53.510
Shino: SHINKAWA.

00:13:53.552 --> 00:13:57.514
Kyoji: I, UH, JUST WANTED
TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR WIN.

00:13:57.556 --> 00:13:59.349
I EVEN BROUGHT SOME PASTRIES.

00:14:01.434 --> 00:14:03.520
AND, HEY, CONGRATS.

00:14:03.562 --> 00:14:05.772
YOU WERE SO AWESOME, ASADA.

00:14:05.814 --> 00:14:07.857
I MEAN SINON.

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:09.317
YOU DID IT.

00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:11.653
YOU'RE THE BEST GUNNER
IN G.G.O. NOW.

00:14:11.695 --> 00:14:12.904
Shino: ( GIGGLES )

00:14:12.946 --> 00:14:15.240
Kyoji: I KNEW ALL ALONG
YOU COULD DO IT.

00:14:15.282 --> 00:14:18.326
YOU DESERVE BEING NUMBER ONE
MORE THAN ANYBODY.

00:14:18.368 --> 00:14:20.996
YOU SHOWED THEM ALL
WHAT REAL STRENGTH'S ABOUT.

00:14:21.037 --> 00:14:23.331
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

00:14:23.373 --> 00:14:25.166
Shino: THANK YOU.

00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:28.587
Kyoji: UM, ASADA...

00:14:28.628 --> 00:14:29.838
Shino: WHAT'S UP?

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:32.841
Kyoji: YOU SAID‐‐
YOU SAID TO WAIT.

00:14:32.882 --> 00:14:34.301
REMEMBER THAT?

00:14:34.342 --> 00:14:36.720
Shino: WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:39.055
Kyoji: WELL, YOU TOLD ME TO WAIT

00:14:39.097 --> 00:14:41.725
AND, IF I DID,
THEN YOU'D BE MINE.

00:14:41.766 --> 00:14:42.892
Shino: HUH?

00:14:42.934 --> 00:14:44.311
Kyoji: I WAITED.

00:14:44.352 --> 00:14:45.812
I WAITED FOR YOU.

00:14:45.854 --> 00:14:48.398
Shino: WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

00:14:49.858 --> 00:14:52.819
Kyoji: FROM NOW ON,
I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

00:14:52.861 --> 00:14:55.989
YOU DON'T NEED HIM
TO PROTECT YOU.

00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:57.282
THAT'S MY JOB.

00:14:57.324 --> 00:14:59.284
I'M GONNA PROTECT YOU NOW...

00:15:00.285 --> 00:15:01.661
FOREVER.

00:15:05.373 --> 00:15:07.667
Shino: ( GASPS )

00:15:09.753 --> 00:15:10.712
SHINKAWA!

00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:12.797
Kyoji: I LOVE YOU, ASADA.

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:15.467
YOU'RE MINE, MY ASADA,

00:15:15.508 --> 00:15:19.304
MY SINON, MINE.

00:15:19.346 --> 00:15:22.098
Shino: ( GASPING ) LET GO!

00:15:24.976 --> 00:15:26.227
Kyoji: HUH?

00:15:28.563 --> 00:15:30.899
WHY'D YOU
PUSH ME AWAY LIKE THAT?

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.734
YOU MADE A PROMISE.

00:15:32.776 --> 00:15:33.860
WE BOTH DID.

00:15:35.028 --> 00:15:37.072
Shino: SHINKAWA.

00:15:52.587 --> 00:15:55.674
SH‐SHINKAWA.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.469
Kyoji: DON'T MAKE
ANY SUDDEN MOVES, ASADA.

00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:02.472
THE SYRINGE I'M HOLDING'S
GOT A DRUG IN IT

00:16:02.514 --> 00:16:04.808
THAT'LL PARALYZE YOUR MUSCLES
IN AN INSTANT.

00:16:04.849 --> 00:16:07.727
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOUR LUNGS
WILL STOP, THEN YOUR HEART.

00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:09.354
Shino: SYRINGE?

00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:12.607
Kirito: MAYBE BY INJECTING
SOME KIND OF DRUG OR SOMETHING.

00:16:12.649 --> 00:16:13.817
THAT'S ONE WAY.

00:16:13.858 --> 00:16:16.111
Kyoji: YEAH,
IT IS THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

00:16:16.152 --> 00:16:18.697
I PROMISED MY DAD
I'D GO TO MED SCHOOL,

00:16:18.738 --> 00:16:21.324
SO IT'S A DONE DEAL.
STUCK WITH IT NOW.

00:16:22.617 --> 00:16:24.160
Shino: THIS IS CRAZY.

00:16:24.202 --> 00:16:27.372
YOU'RE THE OTHER DEATH GUN?

00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:31.251
Kyoji: OOH, I'M IMPRESSED.

00:16:31.292 --> 00:16:34.170
YOU FIGURED OUT
DEATH GUN'S LITTLE SECRET.

00:16:34.212 --> 00:16:35.672
IT'S TRUE.

00:16:35.714 --> 00:16:37.924
I'M DEATH GUN'S
PARTNER IN CRIME.

00:16:37.966 --> 00:16:40.135
Shino: ( GASPING )

00:16:41.261 --> 00:16:42.554
Kyoji: UP TO NOW,

00:16:42.595 --> 00:16:45.098
BEFORE THIS YEAR'S B.o.B.,
ANYWAY,

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.059
I WAS THE ONE PLAYING STERBEN,

00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:53.398
BUT TODAY I INSISTED ON BEING
THE ONE TO DO THE JOB I. R. L.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.776
DON'T YOU SEE I HAD TO BE
THE ONE DOING THE DEED?

00:16:56.818 --> 00:16:59.028
I CAN'T LET
SOME OTHER GUY TOUCH YOU,

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.239
EVEN IF THAT GUY IS MY BROTHER.

00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:03.658
Shino: YOUR BROTHER?

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.327
SO THEN THE PLAYER
WHO BELONGED

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.705
TO THAT MURDER GUILD
IN S.A.O.,

00:17:08.747 --> 00:17:10.832
THAT WAS YOUR OLDER BROTHER.

00:17:10.874 --> 00:17:12.292
Kyoji: FORGET ABOUT HIM.

00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:14.627
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME NOW, ASADA.

00:17:16.004 --> 00:17:18.089
Shino: ( GASPS ) STOP.

00:17:18.131 --> 00:17:20.759
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.344
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:17:23.762 --> 00:17:25.597
WHAT ABOUT CRAM SCHOOL, HUH?

00:17:25.639 --> 00:17:28.267
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA BE A DOCTOR.

00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:29.643
Kyoji: DOCTOR?

00:17:31.186 --> 00:17:34.189
YOU THINK
I GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT,

00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:37.067
ABOUT MY PARENTS,
THOSE GUYS AT SCHOOL?

00:17:37.109 --> 00:17:38.986
THEY'RE ALL ASSHOLES!

00:17:39.027 --> 00:17:41.655
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
HAVE MADE ME HAPPY?

00:17:41.697 --> 00:17:43.991
TO BE THE STRONGEST PLAYER
IN G.G.O.,

00:17:44.032 --> 00:17:45.951
BUT THAT PIECE OF SHIT XEXEED

00:17:45.993 --> 00:17:48.412
LIED ABOUT AGI TYPES
BEING THE STRONGEST,

00:17:48.454 --> 00:17:51.707
AND I FELL FOR IT LIKE AN IDIOT!

00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:53.333
YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:55.377
G.G.O. WAS EVERYTHING TO ME,

00:17:55.419 --> 00:17:58.338
AND I GAVE EVERYTHING UP
IN THE REAL WORLD FOR IT,

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.007
GOD DAMN IT!

00:18:01.383 --> 00:18:04.845
Shino: Y‐YOU KILLED XEXEED
'CAUSE HE LIED?

00:18:04.887 --> 00:18:06.180
Kyoji: OH, COME ON.

00:18:06.221 --> 00:18:07.764
HE WAS THE PERFECT VICTIM.

00:18:07.806 --> 00:18:09.225
WE HAD TO SHOW THE WORLD

00:18:09.225 --> 00:18:11.519
DEATH GUN WAS
THE STRONGEST IN G.G.O.,

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.979
IN ALL THE V.R.M.M.O.s.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.815
WHAT BETTER PERSON TO SACRIFICE
THAN THAT DORK?

00:18:15.856 --> 00:18:18.192
AND NOW THAT THAT'S DONE,

00:18:18.234 --> 00:18:20.319
I DON'T NEED
THIS REALITY ANYMORE.

00:18:21.362 --> 00:18:23.656
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE.

00:18:23.698 --> 00:18:25.658
COME ON, JUST YOU AND ME.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.660
Shino: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:18:27.702 --> 00:18:29.996
Kyoji: WE CAN GO
SOMEWHERE LIKE G.G.O.

00:18:30.037 --> 00:18:33.666
MM. NO, SOMEPLACE
WITH A FANTASY VIBE INSTEAD.

00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:36.252
AS LONG AS IT'S WITH YOU,
I DON'T CARE.

00:18:36.293 --> 00:18:38.170
WE'LL BE REBORN,
BE HUSBAND AND WIFE.

00:18:38.212 --> 00:18:40.631
WE'LL GET A HOUSE.
WE'LL GO ON QUESTS TOGETHER,

00:18:40.673 --> 00:18:43.092
OH, AND HAVE KIDS, TOO.

00:18:43.134 --> 00:18:45.302
IT'LL BE SO MUCH FUN.

00:18:45.344 --> 00:18:47.972
I KNOW IT WILL. COME WITH ME.

00:18:49.098 --> 00:18:50.599
ASADA.

00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:52.184
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:18:52.226 --> 00:18:53.811
YOU ARE.

00:18:53.853 --> 00:18:58.274
MORE THAN ANYTHING,
YOU'RE MINE AND NO ONE ELSE'S.

00:18:58.315 --> 00:19:00.109
I ALWAYS LOVED YOU, ASADA,

00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:01.610
ALWAYS.

00:19:01.652 --> 00:19:04.447
IN SCHOOL, WHEN I HEARD
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

00:19:04.488 --> 00:19:07.116
WHEN I HEARD WHAT YOU DID,

00:19:07.158 --> 00:19:10.870
I COULD LOOK ALL OVER AND NEVER
FIND ANOTHER GIRL LIKE YOU.

00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:15.541
I MEAN, YOU SHOT A REAL BAD GUY
WITH A REAL GUN AND KILLED HIM!

00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:17.960
HOW COOL IS THAT?

00:19:18.002 --> 00:19:19.879
I TOLD YOU, DIDN'T I?

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.006
I SAID YOU HAD REAL POWER.

00:19:23.257 --> 00:19:25.718
WHEN I CAME UP
WITH THE DEATH GUN LEGEND,

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.637
I PICKED THE TYPE 54
AS HIS GUN 'CAUSE OF YOU.

00:19:29.847 --> 00:19:32.433
THAT'S HOW MUCH
I LOVE YOU, ASADA.

00:19:32.475 --> 00:19:35.061
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,

00:19:35.102 --> 00:19:37.146
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

00:19:37.188 --> 00:19:41.108
Shino: ( WHIMPERING ) NO.

00:19:45.071 --> 00:19:47.198
Robber: ( LAUGHING )

00:19:57.583 --> 00:20:00.169
Shino: I DON'T WANT
TO SEE ANYTHING

00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:02.588
OR FEEL ANYTHING ANYMORE.

00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:06.801
THIS ISN'T REAL.

00:20:06.842 --> 00:20:08.844
IT CAN'T BE.

00:20:11.013 --> 00:20:12.848
KIRITO.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.602
YOU WENT TO ALL THAT TROUBLE
TO SAVE ME,

00:20:16.644 --> 00:20:19.230
BUT IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING.

00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:20.564
Kirito: HOW 'BOUT THIS?

00:20:20.606 --> 00:20:23.109
AFTER WE LOG OUT,
I COULD HEAD OVER TO YOU.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:24.401
Shino: ( GASPS )

00:20:24.443 --> 00:20:27.530
IF HE COMES OVER,
HE'LL BE IN DANGER.

00:20:28.906 --> 00:20:31.909
AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:34.912
Sinon: THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:20:34.954 --> 00:20:35.913
Shino: HUH?

00:20:35.955 --> 00:20:37.748
Sinon: UP TO THIS POINT,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.168
ALL WE'VE BEEN DOING WAS
LOOKING OUT FOR OURSELVES.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.504
WE CERTAINLY NEVER FOUGHT
FOR ANYONE ELSE.

00:20:43.546 --> 00:20:47.967
BUT NOW, EVEN THOUGH
IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE FOR US,

00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:50.386
LET'S GO FIGHT FOR SOMEONE ELSE,

00:20:50.427 --> 00:20:52.721
JUST THIS ONCE, ME AND YOU.

00:20:54.223 --> 00:20:55.850
Shino: ( SIGHS )

00:20:58.477 --> 00:21:00.146
Sinon: ( CHUCKLES )

00:21:08.154 --> 00:21:10.948
COME ON. LET'S GO.

00:21:12.449 --> 00:21:14.618
Shino: ( WHIMPERS )

00:21:15.661 --> 00:21:17.997
Kyoji: I LOVE YOU, ASADA.

00:21:18.038 --> 00:21:20.082
Both: ( GRUNTING )

00:21:33.345 --> 00:21:34.597
Shino: ( YELPS )

00:21:36.098 --> 00:21:38.767
Kyoji: A‐ASADA!

00:21:40.561 --> 00:21:41.604
Shino: NO.

00:21:41.645 --> 00:21:43.522
LET GO OF ME! NO!

00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:48.569
Kyoji: ASADA. ASADA.

00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:50.237
ASADA! ASADA!

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:51.989
‐ ASADA! ASADA!
‐ Shino: ( SCREAMS)

00:21:52.031 --> 00:21:54.116
Kyoji: ASADA!

00:21:54.158 --> 00:21:55.326
Shino: ( GASPS )

00:21:55.367 --> 00:21:57.953
Both: ( GRUNTING )

00:21:57.995 --> 00:21:59.121
Kirito: RUN, SINON!

00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:05.085
Shino: KIRITO.
