# SAO Dubtitles
Subtitles for the English dub of Sword Art Online.

# TL,DR
These subtitles are for the blu ray release. They do not contain song lyrics or translations of onscreen text (but may in the future).

# A note about this readme
This readme does contain mild spoilers for Sword Art Online. Read at your own risk.

# Where do these subtitles come from?
These subtitles were ripped from Hulu (though they also exist on Crunchyroll and possibly other sites), and heavily modified by myself.

# What was changed about these subtitles?
These subtitles were completely resynced to match the blu ray release. Most of the time, this means that any intros, outros, commercial cuts, etc required me to resync subtitles. The original subtitles were also quite terribly synced, so I took some liberties with resyncing individual lines in cases where they were truely terrible.

There were a few scenes heavily cut down in the Hulu release, such as the scene with Raios and Humbert with Ronie and Tiese in Alicization. In these cases, whatever subtitles did exist were resynced, and whatever subtitles did not exist were added.

The original subtitles were extremely inconsistent with acronyms. Sometimes writing them like S. A. O., sometimes like S.A.O., sometimes like "S.A.O.", sometimes like "S. A. O.", etc.. I modified the subtitles to have more consistent acronyms. My rules for such were as follows: If the acronym is VR or VRMMO, write it without quotes, periods, or spaces. Otherwise, write it with only periods, such as S.A.O. or G.G.O.

The original subtitles did a very bad job with the names of the characters when saying who is speaking, choosing to call characters by their in-game names or their real names seemingly at random (such as calling Suguha "Leafa" even in IRL scenes, and vice versa). I changed this so that if a character is speaking outside of a game, the subtitles use their real name, and if they are in a game, it uses their game name. (Note that I never changed any subtitle to contradict what a character is saying. For example when Asuna calls Kazuto "Kirito" during a real world scene, the dialogue still accurately says "Kirito". This is only for the part of the subtitle that says which character is speaking.)

Some of the subtitles were fully incorrect from what the characters were saying. For example, in Alicization, whenever a character would refer to the "Final Load Test" the subtitles consistently wrote "Final Stress Test" even though that is not the dialogue. This is now fixed. The subtitles should now accurately reflect the dialogue being spoken.

# What is missing from this archive?
- Sword Art Online Season 1 (2012) - Currently being worked on
- Sword Art Online: Extra Edition (2013) - Will be added in the future
- Sword Art Online The Movie: Ordinal Scale (2017) - Will be added in the future
- Sword Art Online Progressive: Aria of a Starless Night (2021) - Is not on Hulu. I may be able to rip them from crunchyroll but am unsure how currently
- Sword Art Online Progressive: Scherzo of Deep Night (2022) - Same as Aria
- Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online Season 2 (2024) - Same as the Progressive movies
- SAO Abridged (2013-Current) - Not an official series but I will still be fixing the subtitles as they add jokes that get in the way of the subtitles being used as an accessibility tool (Love ya SWE, but cut that out)

# What is currently being worked on?
I'm currently working on Season 1 (they're extra terrible, so it'll be a while) as well as doing a second pass of Season 2

# Some problems with this archive
These subtitles are only for dialogue and sound effects. They do not contain song lyrics or text translation (aka "Signs and Songs"). I will likely add these in the future.

The majority of the subtitles use all uppercase, with the exception of the text indicating which character is speaking, as well as anything in parentheses (extra noises, such as gasps). The only subtitles that are not consistent with this format are those of the second half (episodes 12-23) of Alicization -War of Underworld-, and Alternative: Gun Gale Online. Those subtitles are capitalized "normally". This is how they came from Hulu, and making them consistent is not a priority currently.

The subtitles for Alternative: Gun Gale Online do not use character names to indicate who is speaking, rather using a dash to indicate a change in who is speaking. Maybe I will fix this eventually, but for now it remains inconsistent.

I am only one woman working on this project, not a paid company, or even a group. As such, there may be inconsistencies with the things I changed, or incorrect things that I missed. If there are, feel free to open a github issue or even better, a pull request, I'd greatly appreciate it.

# Final notes
I would like to thank my beautiful girlfriend for putting up with me liking bad media to the point of fixing its subtitles. 

I'd also like to thank Tom Scott for making me care about subtitles as much as I do. 

And finally, I'd like to UNthank the SAO dub subtitling team (or person) who was responsible for the abomination that is the original subtitles which I had to fix.
