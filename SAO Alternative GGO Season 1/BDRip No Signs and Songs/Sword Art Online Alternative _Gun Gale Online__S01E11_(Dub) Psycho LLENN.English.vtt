[explosion]

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:05.843
‐ What was that?

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.212
‐ I think a plasma grenade.

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:09.947
David: Focus, guys.
Pitohui's the mission.

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:12.250
‐ [gunshot]
‐ Open fire on the wall!

00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:14.219
‐ [yelling]

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:15.286
[shotgun blasts]

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:17.788
‐ [groans]
‐ Lax!

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.924
[explosion]

00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:24.529
[photon sword hums]

00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:44.715
‐ Now this is fun.

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:47.918
[yells]

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:48.919
[laughs]

00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:51.256
‐ [yelling]

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:54.592
‐ [grunts]

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.894
‐ I'm not going down that easy!

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:00.798
‐ [laughs]

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.636
It's time to die, boys!

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:10.241
You don't know
when to quit, do you!

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:14.145
‐ What? Did you think
I'd be scared of a glow stick?

00:01:14.212 --> 00:01:17.715
‐ That's right. This kind
of thing doesn't interest you.

00:01:17.782 --> 00:01:19.484
Guns are your jam.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.752
‐ Yeah. So what?

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.588
‐ Bet you didn't know.

00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:27.292
This Muramasa F9,
it's got a neat feature.

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.260
‐ [grunting]

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:39.470
‐ [laughs]

00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:42.573
‐ Is‐‐Is this fun for you?!

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.342
You crazy bitch!

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.744
‐ I'm loving every second
of it, actually.

00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:50.215
And now I'll enjoy
your death, too...

00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:51.716
bitch.

00:01:52.983 --> 00:01:55.153
‐ Pitohui!

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.154
[yells]

00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:58.056
‐ Yes!

00:01:58.123 --> 00:02:00.225
You know it!

00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:03.228
That is me!

00:02:03.294 --> 00:02:05.230
‐ [gags]

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:07.232
[both screaming]

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:09.200
‐ Thanks for playing!

00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:14.839
[laughs]

00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:19.077
[laughing]

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.985
[laughter continues]

00:02:32.623 --> 00:02:34.625
Fuka: Hello! Earth to LLENN.

00:02:34.692 --> 00:02:36.361
Boss: What happened in there?

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:37.628
[brush rustling]

00:02:37.695 --> 00:02:41.099
LLENN: Th‐The whole team's dead.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:44.202
Pito killed
every last one of 'em.

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.203
Fuka: Whoa.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.671
Boss: No way.

00:02:46.737 --> 00:02:48.439
‐ H‐How is someone like me

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:51.309
supposed to beat
someone like that?

00:04:24.237 --> 00:04:25.172
‐ [gasps]

00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:31.978
[whimpers]

00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:34.781
[Terminal buzzing]

00:04:38.018 --> 00:04:39.152
[buzzing stops]

00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:45.992
Spectator: This'll be
the last scan of the tourney.

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.928
‐ Mm. There's only
four teams left.

00:04:48.995 --> 00:04:52.099
‐ Crap.
PM4's got this in the bag.

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:54.767
‐ LLENN can still
pull through, man!

00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:57.104
‐ T‐S is still
up on the rampart.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.172
What are they waiting for?

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:02.842
‐ I bet they'll run out the game
up there, sniping at everyone.

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:03.843
‐ [groans]

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.412
God, they make me sick.

00:05:05.478 --> 00:05:08.181
If they were real men,
they'd fight toe‐to‐toe.

00:05:08.248 --> 00:05:11.018
Except for M, everyone
out there's a friggin' wimp.

00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:14.987
Hang in there, ladies.

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:18.425
‐ How am I gonna do this?

00:05:19.892 --> 00:05:22.695
What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

00:05:22.762 --> 00:05:25.398
Oh, come on. Think.
You need a plan.

00:05:25.465 --> 00:05:28.101
A plan, a plan,
but what kind of plan?

00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:30.770
Boss: New plan, everyone!
Let's storm the cabin!

00:05:30.837 --> 00:05:31.771
‐ Huh?

00:05:31.838 --> 00:05:33.406
Wh‐Wh‐What?!

00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:34.641
[automatic gunfire]

00:05:34.707 --> 00:05:37.444
Wait! Don't go without me!
I'm not ready yet!

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.912
Boss: Sorry.
You're taking too long.

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.182
I'm calling the shots now.

00:05:43.716 --> 00:05:45.018
‐ What's up?

00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:47.754
‐ B‐Boss and her team
are just charging right in!

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.821
‐ Nice.

00:05:48.888 --> 00:05:50.257
‐ No, it's suicide.

00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:52.525
I can't kill Pito without them.

00:05:52.592 --> 00:05:55.328
We need a plan,
but I can't think of any.

00:05:55.395 --> 00:05:56.863
‐ Right.
I'm charging in with 'em.

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:57.930
‐ Huh?!

00:05:57.997 --> 00:05:59.932
‐ That's as good a plan as any.

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:01.701
Just you watch.
We'll catch Pito,

00:06:01.768 --> 00:06:03.003
wrap her up in a mat,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.638
and bring her right back here
in nothing flat.

00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:07.040
‐ [giggling]
‐ No, stop.

00:06:07.107 --> 00:06:08.675
Would you wait a second?!

00:06:08.741 --> 00:06:10.310
Get back here!

00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:11.478
Whoa!

00:06:11.544 --> 00:06:13.913
You gotta be kidding.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.083
Of all the stupid‐‐Come on!

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:19.052
Fuka: Calm down,
and take your time.

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:21.221
You'll get loose eventually.

00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:24.824
‐ Fuka! Didn't you
hear anything I said?!

00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:27.027
You can't charge in
all by yourself!

00:06:27.094 --> 00:06:29.796
‐ Whoever undoes
that Gordian knot

00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:32.365
is destined to rule the world.

00:06:32.432 --> 00:06:35.102
[laughs]

00:06:35.168 --> 00:06:37.937
‐ [groans] Dang it!

00:06:38.005 --> 00:06:39.906
[groans]

00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:43.076
‐ Ladies, hit 'em hard and fast!

00:06:43.143 --> 00:06:45.078
Team: Roger that!

00:06:48.048 --> 00:06:51.118
M: We got four Amazons
heading straight for us.

00:06:53.353 --> 00:06:54.821
They're getting closer.

00:06:54.887 --> 00:06:56.723
Four hundred meters now.

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.591
Standing by for orders.

00:07:00.593 --> 00:07:03.630
‐ Well, well, looky here.

00:07:03.696 --> 00:07:06.833
I see LLENN's friend coming.

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:10.103
She's, uh,
skipping across the field.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.406
The weird thing is
I don't see LLENN anywhere.

00:07:13.473 --> 00:07:16.143
Do you have
any idea why that is?

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:18.345
M: No, I don't. From here,

00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:20.947
it looks like they're
attacking out of desperation,

00:07:21.014 --> 00:07:22.949
like they're
begging to be shot.

00:07:23.016 --> 00:07:25.952
‐ Seems awfully fishy.

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.355
I know they're up to something.

00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:30.757
‐ Well, until we
find out what that is,

00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:32.792
thinning their ranks
is an option.

00:07:32.859 --> 00:07:34.761
‐ I guess that's all we can do.

00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:36.496
Here are your orders, then.

00:07:36.563 --> 00:07:40.367
Kill them
with extreme prejudice.

00:07:41.668 --> 00:07:43.203
‐ [yelps]

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.737
‐ [gasps]
‐ [laughs]

00:07:44.804 --> 00:07:48.141
A bullet bounced off my helmet.
Talk about lucky.

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:49.809
‐ Fuka, stay down!

00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:52.979
‐ [giggles] Nah, I'm good.

00:07:56.916 --> 00:08:00.020
‐ It's really not fair
when they're so short.

00:08:00.953 --> 00:08:04.057
Well? How are you doing?

00:08:04.124 --> 00:08:06.626
‐ I got one so far.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.664
‐ Ohh!
‐ Nice shot!

00:08:11.731 --> 00:08:13.200
‐ He just got another!

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:15.502
‐ Whoa!
‐ [overlapping chatter]

00:08:15.568 --> 00:08:17.270
‐ Oh, come on.

00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:19.439
Sophie: What's up?

00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:22.442
‐ Boss and the others
are on that suicide run.

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:24.211
‐ [sighs]

00:08:36.989 --> 00:08:38.191
[single shot]

00:08:43.063 --> 00:08:45.598
‐ Why's she smiling?

00:08:45.665 --> 00:08:47.567
Aha.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.340
‐ [panting]

00:08:53.406 --> 00:08:54.341
Oh, great.

00:08:54.407 --> 00:08:57.410
Looks like I'm
the last one of us left.

00:09:02.982 --> 00:09:04.584
Gotta hand it to M.

00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:08.455
If there's anyone sharp enough
to figure us out, it's him.

00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:24.404
[crowd groaning]

00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:26.606
Sophie: That's a shame.

00:09:26.673 --> 00:09:29.809
Her timing
was way off at the end.

00:09:29.876 --> 00:09:33.513
‐ I dare you to tell her that
when she gets here.

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:35.350
‐ Come on!

00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:37.786
Fuka: Don't tell me
Alexander the Great's

00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:39.388
still working on that knot.

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:42.257
Remember the prophecy.
It specifically states

00:09:42.324 --> 00:09:45.927
that you cannot rule the world
unless you untie it.

00:09:45.994 --> 00:09:47.129
‐ Yeah, I know!

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.665
[sighs] Stupid knot.

00:09:50.732 --> 00:09:51.966
This'll do you.

00:09:52.034 --> 00:09:54.469
‐ [Fuka screams]
‐ [gasps] Fuka?

00:09:54.536 --> 00:09:56.638
‐ [Fuka screams]
‐ Fuka!

00:09:56.705 --> 00:09:57.639
Fuka!

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.443
I took care of SHINC.
How are you doing?

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.779
‐ Eh, not good. Frustrated.

00:10:04.846 --> 00:10:06.481
LLENN's not coming out.

00:10:06.548 --> 00:10:09.884
I shot up her partner
and everything.

00:10:12.887 --> 00:10:15.657
I can't believe
she's not coming to her rescue.

00:10:15.724 --> 00:10:17.826
‐ God, would you
just finish her already?

00:10:17.892 --> 00:10:19.894
[Pito chuckles] What's that?

00:10:19.961 --> 00:10:22.631
Kindness? Mercy? Compassion?

00:10:22.697 --> 00:10:25.867
M: Mercy and compassion
are the same thing,

00:10:25.934 --> 00:10:28.003
and, no, it's not about that.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.240
LLENN isn't coming to save her,
because she doesn't have to.

00:10:31.306 --> 00:10:33.442
This isn't a real battle.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.644
And while you mess around
with her friend there,

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.479
LLENN's figuring out
our blind spot,

00:10:37.546 --> 00:10:40.449
and the last surviving team's
closing in.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:44.486
I want to X her out ASAP so we
can be ready for everyone else.

00:10:44.553 --> 00:10:46.755
Pito: Can't we just wait
a little longer?

00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:48.723
‐ Fine. I'll kill her.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.192
‐ [sighs]

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:51.826
Okay, jeez.

00:10:54.563 --> 00:10:56.098
Oopsie.

00:10:56.165 --> 00:10:57.666
Only got her hand.

00:10:57.732 --> 00:10:59.868
Still getting
used to this rifle.

00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:07.409
Damn, she's tough!

00:11:07.476 --> 00:11:09.678
LLENN sure knows
how to pick a teammate.

00:11:09.744 --> 00:11:10.912
[laughs]

00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:12.581
She's not a threat anymore,

00:11:12.647 --> 00:11:15.317
at least
for the next two minutes.

00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:19.688
‐ Um, Hey, LLENN,
I got bad news for you.

00:11:19.754 --> 00:11:22.324
It was an honor
serving on your team,

00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:25.527
but my hands and feet are gone,
and I'm stuck.

00:11:25.594 --> 00:11:27.829
‐ That's 'cause you
charged in by yourself!

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:30.732
‐ Yeah, but I don't regret it
or anything. That's for sure.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:32.134
‐ You should!

00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:34.869
‐ Hey, it's better
than sitting around like you,

00:11:34.936 --> 00:11:36.605
all nervous and indecisive.

00:11:36.671 --> 00:11:39.174
I did what I could,
and I'm good with that.

00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:41.010
I bet if you asked
Boss and the others,

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:43.078
they'd say the same thing, too.

00:11:43.145 --> 00:11:44.946

[screams]

00:11:46.548 --> 00:11:48.317
If I killed Pito at the start,

00:11:48.383 --> 00:11:49.751
none of this
would have happened!

00:11:49.818 --> 00:11:53.555
But they dropped us
so far away from each other,

00:11:53.622 --> 00:11:57.026
and then people got in the way,
and my ammo supply went down.

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:59.328
And then,
when I finally get to her,

00:11:59.394 --> 00:12:01.863
she's turned into
a rampaging monster.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.500
I wanted to take a minute and
figure out a plan of attack,

00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:07.702
but everyone just ran in
and got killed.

00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:13.542
Instead of doing something,

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:17.846
I'm still
standing here, shaking.

00:12:17.912 --> 00:12:20.015
Aah! I've had it!

00:12:20.082 --> 00:12:22.217
I'm done worrying about Pito!

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:24.753
She can win this thing
for all I care!

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:27.156
She's so strong,
she probably will.

00:12:27.222 --> 00:12:30.592
Why should I stress over someone
killing her before I do?!

00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:32.494
That's her problem, not mine!

00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:34.963
And if she kills me first,
that's fine, too.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.365
If I die, I die!

00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:39.000
Fuka: So what are you gonna do?

00:12:39.068 --> 00:12:40.402
‐ I'm gonna kill!

00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:42.204
‐ Kill who?
‐ Pito!

00:12:42.271 --> 00:12:43.338
‐ Okay. How?

00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:44.606
‐ I don't know!

00:12:44.673 --> 00:12:47.009
I'll use my gun
if I have bullets left

00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:49.944
or my knife. I don't care
what I use to do it.

00:12:50.012 --> 00:12:51.946
I'm gonna kill Pito and win!

00:12:52.014 --> 00:12:53.815
P‐chan: Awesome!

00:12:53.882 --> 00:12:54.983
[LLENN gasps]

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.219
‐ I'm with you all the way.

00:12:57.286 --> 00:12:59.021
Let's do this.

00:12:59.088 --> 00:13:01.823
‐ Sweet. It's you and me, then.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.194
LLENN: We're gonna
murder Pito together!

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.629
‐ You go, girl. Get her.

00:13:07.696 --> 00:13:10.232
Tanya: Just like in S.J. 1.

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:12.501
Toma: An erratic LLENN
is the best LLENN.

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:14.803
‐ Go, you little psycho. Go.

00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:18.007
‐ Damn it. This is
what I wanted all along.

00:13:18.073 --> 00:13:22.844
This is the go‐for‐broke version
of LLENN I wanted to fight.

00:13:31.322 --> 00:13:34.325
Pito: Look! There she is!

00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:37.228
M: Yup. I see her, too.

00:13:37.294 --> 00:13:39.296
‐ Don't forget. She's mine.

00:13:39.363 --> 00:13:42.233
If you kill her, I'll kill you.

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:43.300
Wait.

00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:45.269
She's running away?!

Come on! We're going after her!

00:13:50.974 --> 00:13:53.210
‐ What'll we do
about her partner?

00:13:53.277 --> 00:13:54.511
‐ We can kill her later.

00:13:54.578 --> 00:13:57.048
‐ You sure? She might be
fully healed by then.

00:13:57.114 --> 00:13:58.449

LLENN's too fast.

00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:07.358
How are we gonna catch her?

00:14:07.424 --> 00:14:09.360
‐ Oh, I already thought of that.

00:14:09.426 --> 00:14:12.129
At top speed,
she's as fast as a car, right?

00:14:12.196 --> 00:14:13.564
‐ So?

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.233
‐ So it should be obvious
how we'll catch her.

Get me in range, idiot!

00:14:30.547 --> 00:14:32.883
‐ If I go any faster
and have to turn,

00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:34.451
there's a chance
you'll get thrown out.

‐ Up to now, I killed
with my fists, my guns,

00:15:53.897 --> 00:15:56.433
some grenades, and a sword,
pretty much everything,

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.436

that is.

How the hell
is she still alive?

00:16:40.477 --> 00:16:42.413
[sighs] I guess
I just winged her.

00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:47.084
I swear, it's either 'cause
she's lucky or small or both.

00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:49.386
She's tough to kill.

LLENN: Dang it.

00:16:51.222 --> 00:16:54.758
Looks like the end for me.

00:16:54.825 --> 00:16:57.328
‐ Do you want me
to get a little closer?

00:16:57.394 --> 00:16:59.130
Pito: No. I'm fine where we are.

00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:01.932
Are you worried I'll miss her
from here or something?

00:17:01.998 --> 00:17:05.069
‐ No. It's just that HP
decreases under water.

00:17:05.136 --> 00:17:07.171
She'll die whether
you shoot her or not.

00:17:07.238 --> 00:17:09.640
I guess I figured
you'd wanna get closer

00:17:09.706 --> 00:17:11.975
so you could look her
in the eyes as she died.

00:17:12.043 --> 00:17:16.147
‐ Whoa. About time you got
into the spirit of this.

00:17:16.213 --> 00:17:20.084
I'm good here. I don't wanna
take any chances around her.

00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:23.420
I'm scared she might kill me
if I drop my guard.

00:17:23.487 --> 00:17:26.223
‐ Wait. You're scared? Really?

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.793
‐ Of course. What do you
think I am, an idiot?

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.697
Sure, I'm scared,
scared of dying.

00:17:33.764 --> 00:17:36.267
That's what makes this
so much fun.

‐ What's Pito waiting for?

00:17:39.803 --> 00:17:41.972

out of her misery now.

‐ [gasps]

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.260
What in the heck is that?!

00:20:16.327 --> 00:20:19.796
Fuka: What in the heck's
it look like?!

00:20:23.534 --> 00:20:26.837
‐ No way. They got geysers here.

00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:34.245
‐ Ah, damn it. Another second,
and they would have hit that.

00:20:34.311 --> 00:20:36.680
They're all going off
right on time, though.

00:20:36.747 --> 00:20:38.482
Talk about punctuality.

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:40.717
LLENN: Faster! Go faster!

00:20:40.784 --> 00:20:41.718
Fuka: I can't!

00:20:41.785 --> 00:20:43.487
‐ Why not?!

00:20:43.554 --> 00:20:44.888
‐ We're out of gas.

00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:46.890
M: We're almost out.

00:20:46.957 --> 00:20:48.592
‐ Of what?!
‐ Of gas.

00:20:48.659 --> 00:20:50.361
‐ Okay, then.

00:20:50.427 --> 00:20:52.363
‐ Ram into 'em!

00:21:14.518 --> 00:21:16.320
‐ [laughs]

00:21:22.026 --> 00:21:24.795
‐ [thinking]
I'm sorry, P‐chan.

00:21:24.861 --> 00:21:28.132
‐ Not even! Do what you gotta.
[giggles]

00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:36.007
‐ [yelling]

00:21:46.217 --> 00:21:48.185
‐ Oh, yes!

00:21:48.252 --> 00:21:53.357
This is what I've been
waiting for all day.

00:21:54.691 --> 00:21:57.394
You're so irresistible...

00:21:57.461 --> 00:21:59.463
I wanna kill you.
