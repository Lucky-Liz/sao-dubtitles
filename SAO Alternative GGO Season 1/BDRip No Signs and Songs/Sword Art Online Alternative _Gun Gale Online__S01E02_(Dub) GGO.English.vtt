00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:06.011
Karen: It's been three months

00:00:06.077 --> 00:00:07.979
since I moved
from home in Hokkaido

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:10.248
to Tokyo to go
to a women's college.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.753
I thought things would be
different for me in Tokyo.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.356
At least, I hoped they'd be,

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:21.359
but things are still the same,
like they were at home.

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:25.496
For one,
I'm still as tall as ever.

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.568
I haven't made
any friends at school

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:31.637
and haven't joined
any clubs, either,

00:00:31.703 --> 00:00:34.405
and my folks still won't let me
get a part‐time job,

00:00:34.472 --> 00:00:36.675
so every day's
the same old story.

00:00:36.742 --> 00:00:39.444
I go to school,
then back to my apartment.

00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:41.212
[gasps]

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:44.282
‐ Don't forget!
We're gonna meet at 1800!

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:45.951
Girls: Okay! [giggling]

00:00:46.017 --> 00:00:49.354
‐ They're so lucky to be
short and cute like that.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.758
If I was like them,
my life would be way different,

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:54.359
‐ and way bet‐‐
‐ [clang]

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:56.427
[groans]

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:58.429
‐ Oh, my goodness!
are you okay?!

00:00:58.496 --> 00:01:01.533
‐ Yeah.
This always happens to me.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.734
[laughs]

00:02:34.327 --> 00:02:37.164
Karen: I got into VR games
during summer vacation.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.466
When I was back home
visiting the folks,

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.702
I caught a story about 'em
on the news.

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.938
Reporter: The world's
first full‐dive VRMMORPG

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:46.306
to use the NerveGear,

00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:48.542
the machine
that revolutionized VR gaming,

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.477
was called "Sword Art Online."

00:02:50.544 --> 00:02:54.648
In 2022, tragedy struck
right when the game launched.

00:02:54.715 --> 00:02:56.784
Ten thousand players
had logged on

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.987
and suddenly found themselves
trapped in the game.

00:03:00.053 --> 00:03:01.622
It took two years to free them,

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.257
and in the end,
4,000 players had died.

00:03:04.324 --> 00:03:06.927
Consequently,
the public perception of VR

00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:08.428
was that it was dangerous,

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:11.298
and no one thought
it would survive the backlash.

00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:15.102
The NerveGear rig
was recalled and destroyed.

00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:16.970
But when the AmuSphere
hit the market,

00:03:17.037 --> 00:03:19.306
A.L.O.ng with the license‐free
developer's package

00:03:19.372 --> 00:03:22.776
called "the Seed,"
interest in VR picked up again.

00:03:22.843 --> 00:03:26.547
Soon, new games made
with the Seed began popping up

00:03:26.614 --> 00:03:29.750
with such frequency, it seemed
everyone had forgotten

00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:32.553
the horrors
of the S.A.O. Incident entirely.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.589
Once again, players
could leave reality behind

00:03:35.656 --> 00:03:39.326
and experience a different life
with all five of their senses,

00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:41.328
but, this time,
in complete safety.

00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:43.897
‐ That's what I want,
a different life.

00:03:43.964 --> 00:03:45.866
‐ [yawns]

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:49.436
Girl: No way!
You're pulling my leg!

00:03:49.503 --> 00:03:51.404
Sorry, Kohi,
but you're the last girl

00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:53.507
I ever expected
to be into VR games.

00:03:53.574 --> 00:03:56.209
So what makes you
so interested in 'em now, huh?

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:58.411
You met a boy in Tokyo,
a cute gamer boy.

00:03:58.478 --> 00:04:00.413
‐ N‐No, I didn't meet anyone.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.583
I just thought I'd try
playing one, is all.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.718
And since you play 'em
all the time, Miyu,

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:06.754
I thought
I could pick your brain.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.322
‐ Go on! Pick away!
My brain's open for picking

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.559
Don't be shy. Ask me anything.

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:14.394
‐ They're not that dangerous
to play anymore, are they?

00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:15.996
‐ Absolutely not!

00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:18.699
The AmuSphere rig's designed
to automatically log players out

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:21.434
if it detects anything janky,
so you don't have to worry

00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:23.103
about getting trapped
in games anymore.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.205
Just kick back,
dive in, and rock out.

00:04:25.272 --> 00:04:28.175
‐ Um, sorry.
I didn't get any of that.

00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:29.610
‐ Honestly.

00:04:29.677 --> 00:04:31.244
All right,
here's what you're gonna do.

00:04:31.311 --> 00:04:34.247
You're gonna go buy the gear,
and then we'll talk.

00:04:34.314 --> 00:04:35.649
‐ Karen: Um...
‐ Yes?

00:04:35.716 --> 00:04:38.385
‐ I was wondering if you
had the AmuSphere in stock,

00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:41.655
that and a VR game
called "ALfheim Online."

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:44.658
Miyu: You got it installed?

00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:47.494
‐ Mm‐hmm.
All I have to do is log in.

00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:51.064
‐ Then log in, be a fairy,
and go on a quest!

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:55.803
I know you're gonna love A.L.O.
as much as I do.

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:59.139
You get to fly around and meet
people in this gorgeous world.

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:02.109
It's gonna blow your mind.

00:05:02.175 --> 00:05:04.344
‐ Link start.

00:05:07.748 --> 00:05:09.883
Game:
Welcome to ALfheim Online.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.886
Please enter
your avatar's name.

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:18.592
Please select which race
you wish to play as.

00:05:19.893 --> 00:05:23.531
You selected Sylph,
the wind fairies.

00:05:23.597 --> 00:05:25.566
Creating avatar.

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:37.811
‐ Wha?! This is horrible!

00:05:37.878 --> 00:05:40.313
[alarm blaring]

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.015
Why'd it give me
a tall avatar?!

00:05:42.082 --> 00:05:44.618
Miyu: I'm so sorry!
I totally forgot

00:05:44.685 --> 00:05:46.319
you had that complex
about your height.

00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:50.390
‐ It's okay, but won't it
let me make my own character?

00:05:50.457 --> 00:05:52.025
‐ Well, your avatar's
created at random,

00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:54.227
so all you can do
is pick a different race

00:05:54.294 --> 00:05:55.495
and hope for the best.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.666
‐ Yeah, I don't think
A.L.O. is my thing.

00:05:58.732 --> 00:06:01.268
‐ Great.
Now you're all traumatized.

00:06:01.334 --> 00:06:04.204
Tell you what? Why don't you
convert your character?

00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:05.639
‐ What do you mean, "convert"?

00:06:05.706 --> 00:06:06.940
‐ Sorry. Converting means

00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:08.542
moving your character
to another game.

00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:11.144
Your LLENN I. D.
is yours for good now.

00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:13.346
You can't take any items
or money with you,

00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:14.815
but you just started,

00:06:14.882 --> 00:06:16.183
so it's not like
you're losing anything.

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:19.587
‐ Convenient. Okay.
I'll try a different game.

00:06:19.653 --> 00:06:21.221
‐ Oh! By the way,

00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:23.023
Elza Kanzaki's next concert's
gonna be in Tokyo.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.392
If I can get tickets,
I'm gonna crash at your place.

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:27.460
Cool? Cool. See you!

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:29.663
[monitor beeping]

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.533
Computer: Your character
will now be converted.

00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:36.369
[alarm beeping]

00:06:36.436 --> 00:06:39.106
‐ I'm still tall, damn it!

00:06:39.172 --> 00:06:42.009
‐ [alarm beeping]
‐ Now I'm tall and stocky!

00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:45.445
That's not even human!

00:06:50.183 --> 00:06:52.119
[panting]

00:06:55.856 --> 00:06:56.890
[groans]

00:06:56.957 --> 00:07:00.060
‐ Your character
will now be converted.

00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:04.932
‐ The 37th time's the charm.

00:07:04.998 --> 00:07:08.736
Please work.
Please work. Please!

00:07:15.442 --> 00:07:18.712
She's perfect.

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:20.981
I found it! [squeals]

00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:23.450
I found it!
I found it! I found it!

00:07:23.517 --> 00:07:27.454
I'm so cute,
super cute and little!

00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:30.524
[laughing]

00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:31.792
‐ Damn, she's teeny.

00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:33.761
‐ Yeah. I wonder
if she's even a girl.

00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:35.696
Man: What,
they let kids in here now?

00:07:35.763 --> 00:07:37.197
Man #2:
She's a little cutie‐pie!

00:07:37.264 --> 00:07:39.667
Man #3: I didn't know
you can get a preteen avatar.

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:40.901
Man #4: Nah, that's an NPC.

00:07:40.968 --> 00:07:42.803
‐ [thinking] I'm so happy!

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.205
Finally, I get to be
short and cute.

00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:48.008
Finally, I'm LLENN!

00:07:48.075 --> 00:07:49.943
[laughs]

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.146
Hang on. What kind
of game is this anyway?

00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:01.321
Where am I?

00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:02.823
‐ Glad you could
make it, maggot!

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.291
‐ Who are you calling a maggot?

00:08:04.357 --> 00:08:07.528
‐ You, but I was wrong.
You're just a dung beetle

00:08:07.595 --> 00:08:10.497
with the personality
of a maggot! Now listen up!

00:08:10.564 --> 00:08:13.601
This world is infested
with horrifying monsters,

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.303
rampaging robots, and players
who love murdering.

00:08:16.369 --> 00:08:18.872
It's my job to teach you
the skills you need

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:22.242
to survive here, even if I
have to kill you to do it!

00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:23.476
‐ I don't‐‐

00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:25.312
‐ You will answer
with a "Yes, ma'am"!

00:08:25.378 --> 00:08:26.614
‐ Yes, ma'am!

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.517
‐ So, dung beetle,
why the hell are you here?

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.185
‐ I wanted to be
a cute girl, is all.

00:08:32.252 --> 00:08:33.587
‐ You came here to survive!

00:08:33.654 --> 00:08:35.989
And here, you need
one of these to survive.

00:08:36.056 --> 00:08:39.159
Tell me, do you know
what this is called?

00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:40.628
‐ A gun, ma'am?

00:08:40.694 --> 00:08:43.864
‐ Correct. You're pretty sharp
for a dung beetle.

00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:44.832
‐ [sighs]

00:08:44.898 --> 00:08:47.535
‐ You can use
two types of guns here.

00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:49.570
One's optical.
The other's live‐ammo.

00:08:49.637 --> 00:08:51.705
Your basic optical gun is light.

00:08:51.772 --> 00:08:54.307
It shoots longer distances
with accuracy.

00:08:54.374 --> 00:08:58.011
The energy packs are a breeze
to swap out, too.

00:08:58.078 --> 00:09:01.148
The drawback is, if you
fire it at another player

00:09:01.214 --> 00:09:04.051
and their shield's up,
it only does half the damage.

00:09:04.117 --> 00:09:05.052
‐ Uh...

00:09:05.118 --> 00:09:07.588
‐ And then
there's live‐ammo guns.

00:09:10.223 --> 00:09:12.492
The bullets they fire
have actual mass

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.663
and can rip through shields
like a hot knife through butter,

00:09:15.729 --> 00:09:17.765
but their trajectory's
affected by wind,

00:09:17.831 --> 00:09:19.132
and the mags can get heavy.

00:09:19.199 --> 00:09:21.635
If you're fighting
monsters in the field,

00:09:21.702 --> 00:09:22.836
use an optical gun.

00:09:22.903 --> 00:09:24.672
Use live‐ammo guns on players.

00:09:24.738 --> 00:09:25.706
You got all that?!

00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:26.874
‐ Yes, I think‐‐

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.076
‐ "Yes," what?!
‐ Yes, ma'am!

00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:30.043
‐ I will now teach you

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.279
the basics
of how to handle a gun.

It shows up
when you or your enemy

00:09:37.718 --> 00:09:39.186
puts a finger on the trigger.

00:09:39.252 --> 00:09:41.622
It shows a bullet's path,
and if you see it,

00:09:41.689 --> 00:09:43.223
you either fire
at its origin point

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.259
or get the hell out of the way.
You got it?!

That is the Bullet Circle.
It shows the area you'll hit.

00:09:55.235 --> 00:09:57.204
When you fire,
your bullet will land

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.740

inside that circle.

At least we know you're
totally worthless as a sniper.

‐ Oh, my gosh.

00:10:58.632 --> 00:11:01.034
Could this game be
any more intense?

00:11:02.605 --> 00:11:03.806
Karen: Even so, I decided

00:11:03.873 --> 00:11:05.474
to keep on playing
"Gun Gale Online."

00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:08.911
Not only did I get to be
short and cute as LLENN,

00:11:08.978 --> 00:11:10.112
but I already went through

00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:11.614
the hassle
of starting the game.

00:11:11.681 --> 00:11:15.184
So I got to work
hunting down monsters.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.521
When I'd kill one, it'd pop
like confetti and disappear.

00:11:18.588 --> 00:11:21.090
It didn't seem like I was
killing anything real.

00:11:21.156 --> 00:11:23.559
I got good
killing low‐level monsters

00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:26.529
and running away from some
of the high‐level ones,

00:11:26.596 --> 00:11:28.297
and sometimes I'd die.

If there was one
I couldn't kill,

00:11:30.332 --> 00:11:33.002
I'd learn how to beat it
from a strategy site.

00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:39.875
Slowly, but surely,
I built up my XP,

00:11:39.942 --> 00:11:41.443

00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:44.814

the murdering back a bit.

00:17:38.936 --> 00:17:41.472
‐ Not even. Hey, I know.

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:43.174
Let's register as friends.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.142
I can teach you a lot
about this game.

00:17:45.209 --> 00:17:47.845
Besides, I'm sick
of playing with sleazy guys.

00:17:47.912 --> 00:17:49.514
Come on. What do you say?

00:17:49.581 --> 00:17:50.515
‐ Okay.

00:17:52.383 --> 00:17:54.318
And that takes care of that.

00:17:54.385 --> 00:17:56.287
We're gonna have fun
playing together.

00:17:56.353 --> 00:17:57.488
‐ Yep!
‐ [sighs]

00:17:57.555 --> 00:17:59.657
I didn't realize it was so late.

00:17:59.724 --> 00:18:01.058
You gonna log off?

00:18:01.125 --> 00:18:02.927
‐ I wanted to go and check out

00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:04.461
some live‐ammo guns
before I did.

00:18:04.529 --> 00:18:07.231
‐ Heck, I know
the best place in town.

00:18:07.298 --> 00:18:11.335
This shop only deals
in rare secondhand stuff.

00:18:11.402 --> 00:18:12.970
Everything here's been looted

00:18:13.037 --> 00:18:16.007
from ruins
and the toughest monsters.

00:18:16.073 --> 00:18:17.742
LLENN: Wow!

00:18:19.611 --> 00:18:21.045
Amazing.

00:18:21.112 --> 00:18:23.648
This place has everything.

00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:24.916
‐ LLENN, over here.

00:18:24.982 --> 00:18:26.551
This looks right up your alley.

00:18:26.618 --> 00:18:28.653
It says
it just came in yesterday.

00:18:29.954 --> 00:18:31.222
Check it out.

00:18:32.123 --> 00:18:34.391
‐ What is that?

00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:39.997
Gosh, that's cute.

00:18:40.064 --> 00:18:41.866
It's just darlin'!

00:18:41.933 --> 00:18:44.669
‐ Someone sounds
like they're from Hokkaido.

00:18:44.736 --> 00:18:46.938
‐ I want it. I need it.

00:18:47.004 --> 00:18:49.707
I gotta have it!

00:18:51.976 --> 00:18:53.511
‐ I know that feeling.

00:18:53.578 --> 00:18:55.212
There's nothing
like walking home

00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:56.681
with a brand‐spankin'‐new gun.

00:18:56.748 --> 00:18:59.551
You wanna get used
to how she handles.

00:18:59.617 --> 00:19:01.118
‐ Yup.

00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:03.454
‐ Now that she's yours,
she needs a name.

00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:06.123
‐ A‐Am I supposed
to give my gun a name?

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.291
‐ Yeah, of course.

00:19:07.358 --> 00:19:09.426
‐ I wonder what to call her.

00:19:10.528 --> 00:19:11.362
I know!

00:19:11.428 --> 00:19:13.565
‐ I hope it's cool. Well?

00:19:13.631 --> 00:19:15.533
What'd you decide to call her?

00:19:16.433 --> 00:19:17.835
‐ She's P‐chan.

00:19:17.902 --> 00:19:19.103
‐ Perfect.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.304
Yeah, it fits.

00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:22.206
And now that P‐chan's
got her name,

00:19:22.273 --> 00:19:24.275
you make sure
to feed her every day

00:19:24.341 --> 00:19:26.077
with the blood of your enemies.

00:19:26.143 --> 00:19:28.279
A gun will never betray you,

00:19:28.345 --> 00:19:30.314
and the more enemies
you kill with her,

00:19:30.381 --> 00:19:31.783
the stronger she's gonna be.

00:19:33.718 --> 00:19:36.788
‐ Yeah. I'll make sure
to kill tons of enemies!

00:19:36.854 --> 00:19:40.725
Karen: So Pito and I teamed up
as a two‐person squad.

00:19:40.792 --> 00:19:43.327
Whenever we were online
at the same time,

00:19:43.394 --> 00:19:45.797
we'd hang out
or go hunting together.

00:19:45.863 --> 00:19:48.700
I never saw her
use the same weapon twice,

00:19:48.766 --> 00:19:51.035
so I figured
she was super rich.

00:19:51.102 --> 00:19:54.238
Other than that, I didn't
really know much about her.

00:19:54.305 --> 00:19:56.674
‐ [yawns]
‐ You got any hobbies, Pito?

00:19:56.741 --> 00:19:58.976
‐ Huh? Mm...

00:19:59.043 --> 00:20:00.612
other than playing G.G.O.?

00:20:00.678 --> 00:20:01.513
Nothing, really.

00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:03.748
‐ Well, I like
listening to music.

00:20:03.815 --> 00:20:06.884
I'm really into stuff
like classical and soundtracks.

00:20:06.951 --> 00:20:10.287
As for pop singers,
Elza Kanzaki's my favorite now.

00:20:10.354 --> 00:20:12.123
‐ Music's your thing, huh?

00:20:12.189 --> 00:20:14.659
I hardly listen to it,
to be honest.

00:20:14.726 --> 00:20:18.029
‐ Seriously? I don't know why,
but I sort of got the impression

00:20:18.095 --> 00:20:20.197
you were a huge fan
of music, too.

00:20:20.264 --> 00:20:21.733
‐ I can't even read music.

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:24.368
Heck, if you knew me IRL,
you'd be shocked!

00:20:24.435 --> 00:20:25.737
‐ Oh, I'm sorry about that.

00:20:25.803 --> 00:20:28.005
We shouldn't talk
about real life in here.

00:20:28.072 --> 00:20:31.142
‐ No, it's okay. We know
each other pretty well by now.

00:20:31.208 --> 00:20:33.745
I mean, at this point,
I don't see what harm it'd do

00:20:33.811 --> 00:20:36.180
if we met in the real world
and introduced ourselves.

00:20:36.247 --> 00:20:40.251
Would you be down for that,
a little off‐line hanging out?

00:20:40.317 --> 00:20:42.687
Think you got the guts to?

00:20:42.754 --> 00:20:46.423
‐ I don't know. I think
you'd be more surprised than me.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.826
‐ I just got an awesome idea.

00:20:48.893 --> 00:20:51.629
How about one of these days,
we have ourselves a duel?

00:20:51.696 --> 00:20:54.331
And if you can beat me,
you get to pick where we meet.

00:20:54.398 --> 00:20:56.701
‐ But I don't wanna
have a duel with you!

00:20:56.768 --> 00:20:59.236
Like, there's no way
I'd ever beat you.

00:20:59.303 --> 00:21:02.139
‐ Okay.
Then how 'bout this instead?

00:21:02.206 --> 00:21:04.742
Train your butt off
'til you think you're ready.

00:21:04.809 --> 00:21:07.044
Then, if you can
blow my head off with P‐chan,

00:21:07.111 --> 00:21:08.479
we can meet up
anywhere you want.

00:21:08.546 --> 00:21:11.048
‐ A‐Are you kidding me?

00:21:11.115 --> 00:21:12.617
Okay, you got a deal!

00:21:12.684 --> 00:21:15.252
One of these days, me and
P‐chan will take you down.

00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:17.889
‐ Sweet.
I'll look forward to it.

00:21:17.955 --> 00:21:20.825
Now then,
let's make it official.

00:21:20.892 --> 00:21:21.959
‐ What do you mean?

00:21:22.026 --> 00:21:24.829
‐ To seal the deal,
we have to clink metal.

00:21:24.896 --> 00:21:27.532
They used to do that
back in the Edo days.

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:28.800
You never heard that?

00:21:28.866 --> 00:21:32.269
‐ Are you, like,
170 years old or something?

00:21:32.336 --> 00:21:34.138
‐ One way to find out.

00:21:34.205 --> 00:21:36.708
Well? Raise your gun
up high like this.

00:21:36.774 --> 00:21:39.010
One day, we'll meet in battle,

00:21:39.076 --> 00:21:41.478
and if I lose to you,
we'll meet in real life.

00:21:41.546 --> 00:21:43.648
It's a promise between women.

00:21:43.715 --> 00:21:45.149
Mm‐hmm!

00:21:45.216 --> 00:21:46.884
[guns clang]

00:21:47.952 --> 00:21:49.921
Karen: One day...

00:21:49.987 --> 00:21:51.623
Pito: Happy New Year, LLENN!

00:21:51.689 --> 00:21:53.290
‐ Happy New Year, Pito!

00:21:53.357 --> 00:21:55.960
‐ So I was wondering,

00:21:56.027 --> 00:21:58.462
have you heard about something
called Squad Jam?

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.131
‐ No. What's that?

00:22:00.197 --> 00:22:05.603
Karen: Pito told me all about
this thing called Squad Jam.
