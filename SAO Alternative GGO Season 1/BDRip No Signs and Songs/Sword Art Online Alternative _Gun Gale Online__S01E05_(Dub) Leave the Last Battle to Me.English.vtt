she's insane enough to do it,

she wrote that letter!

You underestimated my agility.

They can call me a coward,

They don't know
how scary she is.

as you're firing.

Hundred meters!

‐ Da!

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.315
‐ Give me your shoulder.

00:10:42.184 --> 00:10:44.753
Time to die, rabbit!

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:53.395
Oh, no. This is bad.
I'm a goner for sure.

00:10:53.462 --> 00:10:55.397
If I try to run, I'll get shot.

00:10:55.464 --> 00:10:58.633
If I stay, they'll toss
a grenade and blow me up.

Can it work?

00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:05.707
Only one way to find out.

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:08.277
One...

00:11:10.145 --> 00:11:11.480

three.

00:11:20.755 --> 00:11:23.825
‐ Crap.
That explosion's for cover.

00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:29.698
She's going west, heading
for those rock formations.

00:11:29.764 --> 00:11:30.832
Team: Roger that!

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.568
‐ She's good, very good.

00:11:33.635 --> 00:11:36.738
‐ Yeah, she is. We fought
some tough ones up to now,

00:11:36.805 --> 00:11:38.640
but this one's gotta be
the toughest yet.

00:11:38.707 --> 00:11:42.944
‐ It worked. It worked.
It worked! It worked!

00:11:44.046 --> 00:11:45.347
Whoo‐hoo!

00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:47.749
I'll just keep running
and running and running

00:11:47.816 --> 00:11:49.518
and running...

00:11:52.187 --> 00:11:54.789
And then what?

00:11:54.856 --> 00:11:56.425
I can't run forever.

00:11:58.527 --> 00:12:02.464
What did I do that helped me
survive this long?

00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:04.599
How did I beat anyone?

00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:06.901
I was up close.

00:12:06.968 --> 00:12:11.106
Whenever I killed an enemy,
I was always up close.

00:12:11.173 --> 00:12:15.044
That's it. I shouldn't run.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.478
‐ Attagirl, LLENN!

00:12:16.545 --> 00:12:18.747
‐ You finally figured it out!
‐ [gasps]

00:12:18.813 --> 00:12:21.483
‐ Stop running away
from the enemy.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.186
Run straight at them instead!

00:12:24.253 --> 00:12:25.354
‐ What the heck?!

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.256
‐ Use your speed and agility,

00:12:27.322 --> 00:12:29.891
and fight your way,
the best way.

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.361
‐ It's talking.

00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:35.764
‐ Don't worry. I got your back.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.232
‐ This isn't happening!
This isn't happening!

00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:38.700
‐ This isn't happening!
‐ Live or die...

00:12:38.767 --> 00:12:40.169
‐ This isn't happening!
‐ we'll fight together!

00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:43.905

When I find her, I am gonna‐‐

Oh, no.

[radio] Are you back, M?!

00:14:15.531 --> 00:14:16.932
‐ Yup.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.402
For the last battle, anyway.

00:14:21.873 --> 00:14:25.843
[M sighs]
I missed the others. Sorry.

Damn it. Why won't you die?!

‐ Ow, that smarts.

00:15:01.378 --> 00:15:03.047
‐ Are you immortal or something?

00:15:03.114 --> 00:15:05.016
‐ Uh...

‐ I didn't notice
in all the excitement.

00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:36.580
‐ Trust me. It looks painful!

00:15:36.647 --> 00:15:39.851
‐ If it makes you feel better,
my grip's weak.

00:15:39.917 --> 00:15:41.152
‐ You could have fooled me.

00:15:41.218 --> 00:15:43.520
‐ So, munchkin,
what's your handle?

00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:46.023
‐ It's LLENN. And what's yours?

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.427
‐ It's Eva, but everyone
just calls me Boss.

You're out of ammo.

00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:53.797

you totally should be.

Every time we see you,
we can't stop talking

about how tall
and stylish you are.

00:21:40.144 --> 00:21:42.313
I mean, we're all
so short, you know?

00:21:42.379 --> 00:21:44.715
I like how you looked before
with long hair,

even better on you.

but I think I stopped growing.

until the other day,

00:21:57.194 --> 00:22:00.497
I hated being tall,
and then‐‐I don't know.

00:22:00.564 --> 00:22:03.667
It just didn't matter anymore.

00:22:03.734 --> 00:22:05.336

just like that? How'd you do it?

I was doing something where
I had to risk my life a bunch.

00:22:15.312 --> 00:22:18.549

00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:40.471
‐ My name's Karen,
Karen Kohiruimaki,

00:22:40.537 --> 00:22:41.738
and I go to the college.

00:22:41.806 --> 00:22:43.875
‐ You got the coolest name.

00:22:43.941 --> 00:22:46.277
‐ Thanks, Saki.
It's nice to meet you all.

00:22:46.343 --> 00:22:49.680
‐ Is it okay if the next time
we see you, we stop and chat?

00:22:49.746 --> 00:22:50.647
‐ Sure.

00:22:50.714 --> 00:22:52.649
‐ Sweet. We totally will!

00:22:52.716 --> 00:22:53.684
Well...

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.819
All: See you later.

00:22:54.886 --> 00:22:56.420
Karen: See you.

00:23:01.792 --> 00:23:03.227
No way.

00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:05.096
[laughs]

00:23:06.397 --> 00:23:07.899
Saki: Karen?

00:23:07.965 --> 00:23:09.366
It's me again.

00:23:09.433 --> 00:23:13.404
Before you go, is it okay
if I shake your hand?

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.840
‐ Um, yeah, okay.

00:23:20.344 --> 00:23:21.745
‐ [chuckles]

00:23:21.813 --> 00:23:23.014
Congrats on your win,

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.349
but next time, it's gonna be us.

00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:26.851
Got it, munchkin?

00:23:27.751 --> 00:23:29.686
‐ I'm ready anytime you are...

00:23:29.753 --> 00:23:31.222
you Amazon.

00:23:31.288 --> 00:23:34.091
Both: See ya in G.G.O.
