Pito: LLENN.

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:36.969
‐ What is it, Pito?

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:41.374
‐ I'm so happy you decided
to participate in S.J. 2.

00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:44.477
I can't imagine anyone else
pushing me as far as you did.

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:48.581
Thanks to you, I had the kind
of fight I've been dreaming of.

00:01:48.648 --> 00:01:51.618
‐ Thanks to you,
all I got was a stomachache

00:01:51.684 --> 00:01:53.320
from worrying
about having that fight.

00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:54.921
‐ Look on the bright side.

00:01:54.987 --> 00:01:57.090
You'll get third place,
so it was worth it.

00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:59.559
Like they say,
you can't win 'em all,

00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:01.094
but third's
nothing to sneeze at.

00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:03.896
[LLENN chuckles] I was thinking
of letting you take third.

‐ Thanks, but, no, thanks.

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:10.603
I can't settle for anything less
than number one.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.938
Don't get me wrong.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:13.906
It's not the winning
that matters to me.

00:02:13.973 --> 00:02:18.178
It never did. All I want is
to survive this battle royale...

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:20.613
and I intend to.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.515
‐ But it's just a game.

00:02:22.582 --> 00:02:24.284
If you don't survive it,
no biggie.

They'll have
another tourney someday.

‐ I didn't expect you
to understand.

00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:31.191
‐ Well, why don't you
explain it to me, then?

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:33.826
We've got some time
before I kill you.

00:02:33.893 --> 00:02:36.896
‐ Okay, smarty‐pants,
you asked for it.

00:02:36.963 --> 00:02:40.733
I always wanted to play
for real stakes, life or death.

risk your life in a game?

What do you think this is,
"Sword Art Online"?

00:02:47.407 --> 00:02:49.542
You can't be serious.

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:50.943
‐ And what if I am?

00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:53.713
‐ Then you got
lousy taste in games.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.383
Honestly, I'm glad
I came to the VR party late,

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.718

‐ [sighs] You got me good.

00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:29.416
Now I only have
20% of my HP left.

00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:31.184
My bad. I should have known

00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:33.886

to distract me.

00:03:33.953 --> 00:03:35.655

00:03:44.597 --> 00:03:46.333
Well, in that case...

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:50.303
I just have
to kill you with her.

00:04:06.886 --> 00:04:08.221
I don't see it.

Your gun literally saved you.

00:04:39.186 --> 00:04:41.321
Now, why would you
give me your knife?

00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:44.357
Is it a gift, or do you
want me to kill you with it?

00:04:44.424 --> 00:04:45.792
‐ Yeah, in your dreams!

[knife clatters]

LLENN: Fuka!

00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:54.401
Pito: Can I borrow your gun?

00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:55.402
‐ Sure.

00:04:58.805 --> 00:05:00.807

‐ That's what you usually do
with traitors, shoot 'em.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.727
You see, M here
knew your little partner

00:05:20.793 --> 00:05:22.729
was in her Humvee
getting closer,

00:05:22.795 --> 00:05:25.032
so he drove us closer to you,

00:05:25.098 --> 00:05:27.100
but not so I could get
a better shot.

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:29.069
It was so I wouldn't
notice your friend.

00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:31.571
But even before that,
I was onto him.

00:05:31.638 --> 00:05:34.641
When we took on those Amazons
you teamed up with in the field,

00:05:34.707 --> 00:05:36.409
I knew he wanted them dead

00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:39.046
so it would only be
you and me in the end.

00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:41.081

‐ Mm‐hmm.

00:10:21.063 --> 00:10:23.132
What's with the backpack?

00:10:23.198 --> 00:10:25.200
‐ An experienced traveler
packs light

00:10:25.267 --> 00:10:28.037
and buys whatever they need when
they get where they're going.

00:10:28.103 --> 00:10:29.738
You see M anywhere yet?

00:10:29.804 --> 00:10:32.974
‐ His name's Goushi,
Goushi Asougi.

00:10:33.042 --> 00:10:36.678
Goushi: I'm sorry I'm late.
I got stuck in traffic.

00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:37.746
‐ Whoa.

00:10:37.812 --> 00:10:40.982
‐ Hi, Goushi.
This is Miyu Shinohara.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.553
She's my best friend,
my VR mentor, and Fukaziroh.

00:10:44.619 --> 00:10:46.755
‐ 'Sup! Glad to finally meet
the real M!

00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:49.324
You're, like,
way hotter than your avatar.

00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:51.960
I had a dream we were married.
Weird, huh?

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.462
Wanna grab a drink later?

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:56.065
‐ Uh, I'm flattered
you think I'm attractive,

00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:57.599
but I can't go out with you,

00:10:57.666 --> 00:10:59.468
because I'm in love
with someone else.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:02.871
‐ Dang it! That someone else
is Pito, isn't it?

00:11:02.937 --> 00:11:04.573
‐ That's right.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:09.511
Karen: Goushi,
where exactly are you taking us?

00:11:09.578 --> 00:11:10.879
‐ Oh, you don't have to worry.

00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:13.315
I'm not kidnapping you
or anything like that.

00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:17.052
‐ That's good to hear, 'cause,
FYI, we're still teenagers.

00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:19.421
Well, I am.
Kohi turns 20 tomorrow.

00:11:19.488 --> 00:11:22.324
‐ Oh. I didn't know that.
Happy birthday.

00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:24.493
‐ Now you know,
you should get her a present.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.161
‐ I can't now. I'm driving.

00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:27.996
My boss might have one
for her, though.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:32.101
‐ Oh. Hey, your boss wouldn't
happen be Pito, would she?

00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:33.335
‐ Uh‐huh.

00:11:33.402 --> 00:11:35.204
‐ So what's she like?

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.272
‐ I'm not supposed
to say anything.

00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:39.141
She wants to surprise you.

00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:41.310
But if you want, I can tell you

00:11:41.376 --> 00:11:43.345
all about how we met
and fell in love.

00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:45.947
‐ Heck, yeah! Go on.
Tell us. Tell us.

00:11:46.015 --> 00:11:47.249
‐ I don't know.

00:11:47.316 --> 00:11:48.783
‐ Oh, I don't mind, really.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.453
As a matter of fact,
Pito's the one who suggested it.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.090
She said she had nothing
to hide from LLENN.

00:11:55.157 --> 00:11:56.658
But it's your call.

00:11:56.725 --> 00:11:57.792
‐ Kohi?

00:11:57.859 --> 00:12:01.230
‐ Okay. if you don't mind
and Pito said to.

00:12:02.131 --> 00:12:03.265
‐ Take a look at this.

00:12:03.332 --> 00:12:06.401
Miyu: So what's up
with Mr. Tubbs?

00:12:06.468 --> 00:12:07.736
He looks like a beached whale.

00:12:07.802 --> 00:12:10.039
Definitely a zero
on the boyfriend scale,

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:12.274
a big, fat zero.

00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:15.210
‐ Sorry, why are you
showing this to us?

00:12:15.277 --> 00:12:17.912
‐ That's me,
back when I first met Pito.

00:12:17.979 --> 00:12:19.681
‐ No way!

00:12:19.748 --> 00:12:21.250
Yeah, that is you!

00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:24.886
Your, eh, hair's different,
but it's the same handsome face.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.588
‐ Why, thank you very much.

00:12:26.655 --> 00:12:28.457
You know,
ever since I can remember,

00:12:28.523 --> 00:12:29.991
I'd been grossly overweight.

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:33.795
I had no self‐confidence
and no social skills whatsoever.

00:12:33.862 --> 00:12:36.665
And then I saw her.

00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:40.002
She was so beautiful,
I fell in love on the spot.

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:41.303
Miyu: You ask her out?

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.404
‐ No, I stalked her.

00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:43.738
‐ Hey, officer!

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:47.109
‐ So, then,
that girl was Pito, I guess?

00:12:47.176 --> 00:12:48.110
‐ Yeah.

00:12:48.177 --> 00:12:50.979
To my eyes, she was a goddess.

00:12:51.046 --> 00:12:54.549
I've never seen a more beautiful
woman in my life before that day

00:12:54.616 --> 00:12:56.318
and haven't seen one since.

00:12:56.385 --> 00:12:58.720
‐ Uh, there's
two gorgeous honeys back here.

00:12:58.787 --> 00:13:00.789
‐ No offense.
You're both very pretty,

00:13:00.855 --> 00:13:03.358
but you don't
hold a candle to Pito,

00:13:03.425 --> 00:13:04.893
to me, anyway.

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:06.728
‐ How tragic. Please go on.

00:13:06.795 --> 00:13:09.631
‐ We officially met one evening.

00:13:09.698 --> 00:13:12.967
I was doing my usual routine,
following her,

00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:15.670
staring at her beautiful figure
as she walked,

00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:18.707
fantasizing about walking
next to her.

00:13:18.773 --> 00:13:20.509
‐ Creepy! And?

00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:22.244
‐ All of a sudden, she stopped,

00:13:22.311 --> 00:13:24.213
turned around,
and started talking to me,

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:27.482
and then she asked me to come
back to her apartment with her,

00:13:27.549 --> 00:13:28.883
‐ so I did.
‐ [squeals]

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.586
‐ Before I knew it,
she had me hogtied on the floor.

00:13:31.653 --> 00:13:33.822
‐ What?
‐ She scolded me,

00:13:33.888 --> 00:13:34.956
then cursed me.

00:13:35.024 --> 00:13:37.026
Then she beat the living hell
out of me.

00:13:37.092 --> 00:13:38.893
She called me a bastard

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.197
and said she knew
I was following her all along.

00:13:42.264 --> 00:13:45.934
I found out my goddess
was really a demon in disguise,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.837
a sadist with a penchant
for violence and destruction.

00:13:48.903 --> 00:13:51.406
She took a ton
of embarrassing photos

00:13:51.473 --> 00:13:53.175
and threatened
to go to the police

00:13:53.242 --> 00:13:54.843
and accuse me of stalking.

00:13:54.909 --> 00:13:57.746
I was pretty much
her slave after that,

00:13:57.812 --> 00:13:59.748
or manservant.
Take your pick.

00:13:59.814 --> 00:14:02.284
I was at her beck and call
every day.

00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:04.953
I couldn't have a job
or go to college.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.954
‐ That sounds...

00:14:06.021 --> 00:14:07.256
‐ Wonderful, I know.

00:14:07.322 --> 00:14:08.957
They were
the best days of my life.

00:14:09.024 --> 00:14:09.758
Both: Huh?

00:14:09.824 --> 00:14:11.326
‐ Living with a beautiful woman

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.128
and indulging her whims,

00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:15.564
for a man like me,
there's no greater blessing.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.967
‐ [thinking] Now I get it.
"M" stands for "masochist."

00:14:19.034 --> 00:14:20.935
‐ Uh‐huh. Sounds like love.

00:14:21.003 --> 00:14:24.239
‐ It is.
It might not be conventional,

00:14:24.306 --> 00:14:26.375
but we loved each other.

00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:28.177
We still do.

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:31.113
Miyu: Is that why you lost
all that weight? For her?

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.548
‐ Actually, she had me
running errands all the time,

00:14:33.615 --> 00:14:35.384
so it just happened.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.718
‐ We should
totally write a book,

00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:38.453
"Lose Weight
the Manservant Way"!

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.488
[laughs] We'll be rich!

00:14:39.554 --> 00:14:41.423
‐ Yeah, no.
‐ Aww.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.791
‐ Anyway, there we were,

00:14:42.857 --> 00:14:45.694
living together in our own
happy, warped way,

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.198
and then November the sixth,
2022, happened.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:50.199
‐ Miyu: Huh?
‐ [gasps]

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:51.800
‐ What happened then?

00:14:51.866 --> 00:14:55.804
Karen: That's the day
"Sword Art Online" went live.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.608
The day she missed out
on playing a real death game

00:14:59.674 --> 00:15:02.844
and started looking for
that experience in other games.

00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:05.980
She thought she found it
with "Gun Gale."

00:15:07.482 --> 00:15:09.618
Miyu: No way! [pants]

00:15:09.684 --> 00:15:12.521
Elza Kanzaki's secret concert?!

00:15:12.587 --> 00:15:13.788
Karen: Goushi?

00:15:13.855 --> 00:15:16.525
‐ The real Pito owns this club.

00:15:16.591 --> 00:15:18.727
She's the reason Elza's famous.

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:21.696
She discovered her and had her
play her first shows here.

00:15:21.763 --> 00:15:23.965
‐ Dude, we get to see
Elza Kanzaki live!

00:15:24.033 --> 00:15:27.069
You won't owe me a thing
after this ever again, Kohi!

00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:28.737
‐ The show is about to start.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.105
Come on.

00:15:33.625 --> 00:15:36.161
[audience murmuring softly]

00:15:38.015 --> 00:15:39.416
‐ [gasps]

00:15:39.483 --> 00:15:40.417
‐ [playing "Rea(s)oN"]

00:17:02.566 --> 00:17:04.268
Karen: Um, hello.

00:17:04.335 --> 00:17:05.269
Miyu: Howdy!

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.671
Goushi: Let me introduce you.

00:17:07.738 --> 00:17:11.075
This is the owner
of the club, Ms. Rei Satou.

00:17:11.142 --> 00:17:12.143
‐ Nice to meet ya.

00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:14.011
Let's see.
Which one of you's LLENN,

00:17:14.078 --> 00:17:15.612
and which one's Grenade Girl?

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:18.249
Wait. Don't tell me. I got this.

00:17:18.315 --> 00:17:19.583
Oh.

00:17:20.484 --> 00:17:22.819
[Karen applauds]

00:17:22.886 --> 00:17:26.623
Your voice was the most
beautiful I ever heard.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.060
I wish I could have
applauded you that day.

00:17:29.126 --> 00:17:30.027
‐ Wait. What day?

00:17:30.094 --> 00:17:33.630
‐ I never heard anyone
sing it so well,

00:17:33.697 --> 00:17:36.200
the best "Erlkönig" ever.

00:17:38.635 --> 00:17:39.936
‐ [giggles]

00:17:40.004 --> 00:17:41.438
[laughing]

00:17:41.505 --> 00:17:43.440
‐ Huh?

00:17:43.507 --> 00:17:45.442
‐ [laughing continues]
‐ Miyu: Wait. No.

00:17:45.509 --> 00:17:46.910
Huh?!

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.448
‐ [sighs]

00:17:51.515 --> 00:17:52.949
How'd you know?!

00:17:53.017 --> 00:17:54.585
‐ I suspected.

00:17:54.651 --> 00:17:56.553
‐ For one thing,
Goushi got us here

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.589
right before
your concert started.

00:17:58.655 --> 00:17:59.956
If it were any earlier,

00:18:00.024 --> 00:18:02.459
he would have run the risk
of me catching on.

00:18:02.526 --> 00:18:03.927
But then when he brought us

00:18:03.994 --> 00:18:06.430
to your dressing room,
of all places,

00:18:06.497 --> 00:18:08.965
and introduced Rei here
as Pito, well,

00:18:09.033 --> 00:18:11.568
I figured the real Pito, you,

00:18:11.635 --> 00:18:13.504
would want to see
if she fooled me.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.472
‐ [sighs]
Anything else give me away?

00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:18.009
‐ There was one other thing,
actually.

00:18:18.075 --> 00:18:20.677
It was how Goushi
knew my name, my address,

00:18:20.744 --> 00:18:22.079
and what I really looked like.

00:18:22.146 --> 00:18:24.615
‐ Yeah. He told me
he went to see you

00:18:24.681 --> 00:18:26.917
and begged you
to sign up for S.J. 2.

00:18:26.983 --> 00:18:28.385
Karen: It hit me after he left.

00:18:28.452 --> 00:18:32.123
I gave all that info,
my name, address, and the fact

00:18:32.189 --> 00:18:36.760
I played a little pink avatar
in G.G.O. to one person,

00:18:36.827 --> 00:18:39.996
Elza, Elza Kanzaki.

00:18:40.064 --> 00:18:42.966
I wrote all that stuff
in a fan letter to you

00:18:43.034 --> 00:18:44.701
and sent it
to your talent agency.
