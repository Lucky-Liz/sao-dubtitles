[gasps]

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.484
Eh?

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:15.653
Whoa!

00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:25.196
‐ Don't tell me.
I look weird, right?

00:00:25.263 --> 00:00:27.098
‐ Mm‐mmm! No, not even!

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:29.300
You're wicked cute!

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:32.903
‐ Aww, yeah! That's me?!

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.605
Oh, my gosh.

00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:36.474
I can totally work with this.

00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:38.443
Wish the boobs
were a little boobier,

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:39.644
but what can you do?

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.679
‐ Uh, excuse me, miss.
‐ Yeah?

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:44.082
‐ That's the F‐8000 model,
isn't it?

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.218
I wanna buy it, your account,
everything! Name your price!

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:49.920
‐ I don't know, mister.
I kinda like this model.

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:52.290
‐ Whoa! Wait! Gimme your info!

00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:25.685
LLENN: Look at your stats!

00:02:25.752 --> 00:02:26.987
Glad you're on my team!

00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:29.756
‐ A thousand credits? That's it?

00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:31.591
This is one cheap‐ass game.

00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:34.261
‐ Yeah, they don't give you
much to start with.

00:02:34.327 --> 00:02:37.430
Don't worry, though. I can
transfer some funds to you.

00:02:37.497 --> 00:02:39.099
‐ Don't spend it on me here.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.569
Save it for when I come down to
Tokyo for Elza's next concert.

00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:44.037
Remember how you said
you'd take me

00:02:44.104 --> 00:02:46.373
to some expensive
sushi place after?

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.975
‐ Hey, I never said that!

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:49.642
‐ Busted!

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.311
‐ Well, maybe if we win‐‐

00:02:51.378 --> 00:02:53.613
‐ I totally heard that!
You can't take it back.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.615
I'll remember what you said.

00:02:55.682 --> 00:02:57.550
‐ You need a gun, Miyu.

00:02:57.617 --> 00:02:59.252
Sorry. I mean Fukaziroh.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.389
Wait. Isn't Fukaziroh
what you called your dog?

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:05.425
Why'd you name him that?

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:06.927
‐ [barks]
‐ Fukaziroh: I wanted a dog

00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:08.962
for a first pet,
but my folks said nope,

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.865
so I got a sparrow instead
and called him Tarou Shinohara,

00:03:11.932 --> 00:03:13.600
and when I finally got a dog

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:15.235
I called him Fuka Jirou.
Clever, huh!

00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:20.640
[sighs] Poor ol' Fukaziroh.
Rest in peace, little fur ball.

00:03:20.707 --> 00:03:24.011
Amen. But you still
need money to buy a gun.

00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:25.913
‐ Oh, no worries.
Just talk to the guy

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.614
who asked you
to sign up for this.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.550
‐ I could ask Goushi. Eh?

00:03:30.617 --> 00:03:32.252
‐ Cool, DM him,
and see what he says.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.821
While you're doing that,

00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:36.523
I'm gonna see how many creepers
I can get to creep on me.

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:37.524
‐ Wait! You what?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.826
[yelps]

00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:47.868
‐ In case you're wondering,
43 dudes hit on me.

00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:50.804
I guess female avatars
are hard to come by here,

00:03:50.871 --> 00:03:53.640
which means I could set up
a reverse harem if I wanted.

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:56.643
‐ [groans]
‐ Well? What'd your pal M say?

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.545
Will he spot me some credits?

00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:00.713
‐ Yup. He said no problem.

00:04:05.018 --> 00:04:07.154
He left it in that trash bin.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.655
‐ Awesome!

00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:16.663
Huh. Guess that's it.

00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:21.268
Convenient.
Password's preloaded.

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:22.602
‐ Oh?

‐ [laughs]

00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:29.542
Wait. That amount's
not a mistake, is it?

00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:31.778
‐ It's legit.
‐ He doesn't expect me

00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:33.146
to pay him back with a kidney

00:04:33.213 --> 00:04:35.348
or work this off
on a tuna boat, does he?!

00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:37.017
‐ I doubt it.

00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:39.252
‐ Hmm.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.922
Welp, whoever M is,
I'm marrying him.

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:44.057
I need his info right now.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.630
I'm super glad my strength and
stamina levels transferred over.

00:04:50.697 --> 00:04:52.900
I'll load up on gear I love.

00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:55.568
I'm talkin' swords, axes,
and long lances!

00:04:55.635 --> 00:04:57.570
‐ This game doesn't have those!

00:04:57.637 --> 00:05:00.740
So? Do you see
anything you like?

00:05:00.808 --> 00:05:03.243
‐ Uh‐uh. I'm not feeling these.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.579
I was hoping to carry something
a little more medieval.

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:08.215
‐ [thinking]
If Pito or M were here,

00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:11.584
they could point her
in the right direction. [gasps]

00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:14.922
I know a place that might
have what you're looking for!

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:15.956
‐ Okay!

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.191
LLENN!

00:05:18.258 --> 00:05:20.193
[gasping]

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.996
This gun is super cool.

00:05:23.063 --> 00:05:24.865
It's the prettiest,
most gorgeous,

00:05:24.932 --> 00:05:28.068
most beautiful gun
I've ever seen! [giggles]

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:30.804
‐ That thing? Are you kidding?

00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:32.806
It's fugly.

00:05:32.873 --> 00:05:35.508
‐ That right there's
a brand‐spankin'‐new

00:05:35.575 --> 00:05:36.910
repeating grenade launcher.

00:05:36.977 --> 00:05:39.913
Heh! I got a pair of 'em in
just the other day.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.482
‐ A grenade launcher? For real?

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:45.118
‐ Yeah, you can shoot grenades
instead of throwing 'em.

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:49.722
The ammo looks like an oversized
bullet filled with gunpowder.

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:50.824
‐ Sounds dangerous.

00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:52.292
‐ If you like
long‐range weapons,

00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:54.161
that right there's
your honey bunny.

00:05:54.227 --> 00:05:56.696
It shoots grenades
up to 400 meters out.

00:05:56.763 --> 00:05:58.731
‐ Now you're talking!
It's not only cute,

00:05:58.798 --> 00:06:00.834
it's even radder
than a plain old gun!

00:06:00.901 --> 00:06:04.204
‐ When you aim, the Bullet Lines
are these cool parabolas!

00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:06.874
And since it's a revolver,
you can send six grenades

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.541
flying at your enemy
in three seconds!

00:06:08.608 --> 00:06:11.444
‐ That's insane! What kind
of damage does six shots do?

00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.181
‐ One shot creams everything
in a five‐meter radius.

00:06:14.247 --> 00:06:15.615
Times that by six!

00:06:15.682 --> 00:06:18.151
That thing's the gnarliest
grenade launcher on the market!

00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:21.121
‐ Yippee! I want it!
I'm buying it!

00:06:22.422 --> 00:06:23.756
‐ Dang! Three mil?!

00:06:23.824 --> 00:06:25.492
‐ Oh, don't worry
about the price.

00:06:25.558 --> 00:06:27.360
We have a sugar daddy,
after all.

00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:28.428
I'll take two, sir.

00:06:28.495 --> 00:06:29.496
‐ Seriously?
‐ Seriously?

00:06:29.562 --> 00:06:31.098
‐ I wanna go in
dualies blazing.

00:06:31.164 --> 00:06:33.166
‐ I'll take all the ammo, too!
‐ Don't you wanna‐‐

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:34.701
‐ Would you stop worrying
about the money?

00:06:34.767 --> 00:06:35.803
We have a sugar daddy.

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:37.204
‐ Want me to take
the sights off?

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.239
Having the Bullet Circle
makes it kinda redundant.

00:06:39.306 --> 00:06:41.208
‐ Sure! Go right ahead!
‐ But, shouldn't‐‐

00:06:41.274 --> 00:06:43.176
‐ Don't worry.
We have a sugar daddy.

00:06:43.243 --> 00:06:47.380
Now that I'm strapped, I wanna
take these bad boys for a spin.

00:06:47.447 --> 00:06:49.349

Bullet Circles are
the best invention ever!

00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:28.757
‐ I wonder what the Lines
from your guns look like.

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.826
Could you aim at me for a sec
so I can check 'em out?

00:07:31.893 --> 00:07:33.028
‐ [radio] You got it!

00:07:38.633 --> 00:07:40.802
‐ Yup, those are
definitely parabolas,

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:42.504
just like the seller said.

00:07:42.571 --> 00:07:44.873
‐ Since you're there,
why don't you practice dodging?

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:45.874
‐ Huh?

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.409

‐ Mmm. You sure are fast!

00:07:53.448 --> 00:07:55.284
‐ [groans]
‐ Nice hustle, you.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.520
‐ Oh, my gosh.
Don't you "nice hustle" me!

00:07:58.587 --> 00:07:59.654
That was scary!

00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:02.757
‐ Oh, please.
S.J. 2's gonna be way scarier.

00:08:02.824 --> 00:08:04.026
‐ Yeah, I guess.

00:08:04.093 --> 00:08:07.596
‐ Man, these things
are so fun to fire off.

00:08:07.662 --> 00:08:09.531
They're not the best weapons
to main

00:08:09.598 --> 00:08:11.233
if a girl's
playing solo, though.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.602
These are better
for a party‐play situation,

00:08:13.668 --> 00:08:15.437
where you can use 'em
for support.

00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:18.107
Welp, I guess
that means you take point,

00:08:18.173 --> 00:08:20.042
and I'll hang back
and bring the fire.

00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:21.743
‐ Okay! Sounds like a plan.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.147
Speaking of, there's
a battle tactic I wanna try.

00:08:25.214 --> 00:08:26.748
‐ Cool. What is it?

00:08:26.815 --> 00:08:30.385
‐ I'll tell you about it after
we sign up for the tourney.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.822
Boss: All right, ladies,
listen up.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.824
It's do‐or‐die time.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.127
We've gotten stronger as a team,

00:08:38.193 --> 00:08:40.395
and if we can harness
that strength,

00:08:40.462 --> 00:08:43.432
we'll have a good shot
at winning S.J. 2.

00:08:43.498 --> 00:08:46.235
There's only one player
to worry about,

00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:49.238
the big guy who teamed up
with LLENN last time, M.

00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:51.873
I'm sure he'll be
in this tourney, too.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.545
He's a phenomenal sniper and
packs a strong portable shield.

‐ [whimpers]

00:08:57.712 --> 00:08:59.248
‐ We need to find something

00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:01.483
that'll punch
through that shield of his.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.618
I'm talkin' a powerful weapon,

00:09:03.685 --> 00:09:06.655
so I say we spend tomorrow
looking for it.

00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:08.223
Team: Yes, ma'am!

00:09:09.124 --> 00:09:12.227
[cell phone buzzes]

00:09:13.862 --> 00:09:15.897
‐ [gasps] No way!

00:09:15.964 --> 00:09:17.366
‐ Something wrong, Kana?

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.368
‐ LLENN signed up
for the tourney.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.470
‐ Are you sure it's her?

00:09:21.536 --> 00:09:23.638
‐ "Team LF."

00:09:23.705 --> 00:09:25.540
According to this,
they're seeded,

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.243
so the L in their name
has to stand for LLENN.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.645
‐ I'm so lookin' forward
to playin' this now!

00:09:30.712 --> 00:09:33.948
‐ That's so weird. I wonder
what made Karen change her mind.

00:09:34.016 --> 00:09:37.586
‐ A soldier doesn't poke her
nose into her enemy's business.

00:09:37.652 --> 00:09:39.421
In fact,
until the tourney starts,

00:09:39.488 --> 00:09:41.123
no one's allowed
to contact Karen.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.026
She's our enemy now.
Is that understood?

00:09:44.093 --> 00:09:45.327
Team: Roger that, Boss!

00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:47.196
‐ After this is over,

00:09:47.262 --> 00:09:49.064
I'd love to have
more of her cookies.

00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:51.266
‐ I like those
marshmallow things she had.

00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:53.268
‐ Her Hokkaido nommies
were good!

00:09:53.335 --> 00:09:55.204
‐ That English tea
was amazing, too.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.407
‐ I'll say it was!
I bet it was the expensive kind.

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:00.642
‐ All right ladies,
let's cut the chatter.

00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:02.611
It's time to put
our game faces on.

00:10:02.677 --> 00:10:05.780
Let's get ourselves ready
to win this thing!

00:10:05.847 --> 00:10:07.216
Team: Yeah!

00:10:07.282 --> 00:10:09.418
[phone line ringing]

00:10:11.286 --> 00:10:12.821
‐ Hey, it's me.

00:10:12.887 --> 00:10:14.156
I have good news.

00:10:14.223 --> 00:10:16.291
Your little friend
just signed up.

00:10:19.194 --> 00:10:21.330
Man: Oh! Ho ho ho! Yeah!

00:10:21.396 --> 00:10:22.797
You guys seein' this?

00:10:22.864 --> 00:10:25.567
‐ We're so gonna ventilate
that little pisser!

00:10:25.634 --> 00:10:27.536
‐ That pink midget's
gonna go down.

00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:30.205
‐ Not just her.
The Japan Machine Gun Lovers

00:10:30.272 --> 00:10:32.941
are gonna blast the hell
outta everyone we meet!

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.909
‐ [team whoop]
‐ [monster roars]

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.551
‐ All right, get him!

00:10:42.617 --> 00:10:43.818
‐ Yup!

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.955
I've got one mission,

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.723
beat Pito!

00:10:54.796 --> 00:10:56.165
The only way to save her

00:10:56.231 --> 00:10:59.334
is for me to kill her.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.376
‐ The preliminaries started.

00:11:05.442 --> 00:11:08.812
‐ Good! Gives us time
to kick back.

00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:13.217
‐ Being seeded
sure has its benefits.

00:11:13.284 --> 00:11:15.752
By the way, Fuka,
do you know the rules?

00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:17.154
‐ I looked at 'em.

00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:19.756
‐ Uh‐huh.
So it's a battle royale

00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:22.826
between 30 teams
on a special ten‐kilometer map.

00:11:22.893 --> 00:11:24.261
Teams have two to six players,

00:11:24.328 --> 00:11:27.164
and even though they're enemies,
they can ally if they want.

00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:28.965
You know what the SAT-scan is?

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:31.402
‐ It gives the location
of all the team leaders

00:11:31.468 --> 00:11:33.270
every ten minutes
on your Terminal.

00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:35.406
You're gonna be
our team's leader, right?

00:11:35.472 --> 00:11:37.174
‐ Yup. Now check this out.

00:11:37.241 --> 00:11:38.975
This time,
something's different.

00:11:39.043 --> 00:11:41.745
‐ In the first Squad Jam,
the enemy teams' names

00:11:41.812 --> 00:11:45.249
weren't displayed on the map,
but in S.J. 2, they will be.

00:11:45.316 --> 00:11:48.719
‐ Convenient. After
the first scan ten minutes in,

00:11:48.785 --> 00:11:50.421
everyone will know
which team is where.

00:11:50.487 --> 00:11:53.090
‐ That info will come in handy
for our mission.

00:11:53.157 --> 00:11:56.493
‐ We'll know right where Pito's
team is every scan.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.697
They're called PM4.
Remember that.

00:12:00.764 --> 00:12:03.200
‐ PM4. You got it.

00:12:03.267 --> 00:12:04.701
Man, what a trip.

00:12:04.768 --> 00:12:06.803
I can't believe
we're playin' a game

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.740
to keep a couple of weirdoes
from killing themselves.

00:12:09.806 --> 00:12:13.310
‐ Yeah. It's more
than a game for Pito.

00:12:13.377 --> 00:12:16.280
Something else to worry about
is team SHINC.

00:12:16.347 --> 00:12:17.714
They're super‐tough.

00:12:17.781 --> 00:12:20.317
They're a rhythmic gymnastics
team in real life.

00:12:20.384 --> 00:12:22.586
We should avoid them
'til I take Pito out.

00:12:22.653 --> 00:12:24.888
After that,
they can kill us for all I care.

00:12:24.955 --> 00:12:27.158
‐ Not even! We're gonna
burn those chicks down

00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:28.859
and wipe out
all the other teams, too!

00:12:28.925 --> 00:12:31.662
Don't you dare blow your chance
to be two‐time champ.

00:12:31.728 --> 00:12:34.931
‐ Okay, fine, whatever you say.
But we'll be facing

00:12:34.998 --> 00:12:37.201
the other teams
from the last tourney, too.

00:12:37.268 --> 00:12:40.537
They might have upgraded their
skills and weapons since then.

00:12:40.604 --> 00:12:42.939
Stay sharp,
and keep your guard up.

00:12:43.007 --> 00:12:45.942
‐ Roger dodger! Hmm.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.145
‐ [sighs]

00:12:48.212 --> 00:12:50.781
‐ What's with that face?
Is it something you ate?

00:12:50.847 --> 00:12:53.150
It's your stomach, isn't it?
You gotta poop.

00:12:53.217 --> 00:12:54.551
‐ No, I don't have to poop!

00:12:54.618 --> 00:12:58.789
It's just this thing with Pito
suddenly hit me.

00:12:58.855 --> 00:13:01.358
I don't know if I'm
good enough to beat her,

00:13:01.425 --> 00:13:04.661
and if I can't, people will die.

00:13:04.728 --> 00:13:07.764
‐ Beating yourself up about it
now isn't gonna help anyone.

00:13:07.831 --> 00:13:11.468
Worry about the ifs and hows
on the day. Got it?

00:13:11.535 --> 00:13:15.406
Now that that's settled,
I'm ordering more drinks.

00:13:18.142 --> 00:13:20.377
Here. Drink up. It's my treat.

00:13:20.444 --> 00:13:22.979
‐ [sighs]

00:13:23.047 --> 00:13:27.584
Thanks, Miyu. You don't know
how much I appreciate this.

00:13:27.651 --> 00:13:31.022
‐ Oh, please. It's just
a mug of iced tea, no biggie.

00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:32.389
‐ Not the tea, you dork!

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:35.659
Thank you for always
being there when I needed you

00:13:35.726 --> 00:13:39.963
and for coming to G.G.O.
and for having my back in S.J. 2.

00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:40.997
You're the best.

00:13:41.065 --> 00:13:42.866
‐ No worries. Between us girls,

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:45.002
all that stuff's
a part of being friends.

00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:46.403
We never need to say thanks.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.640
But if you want,
you can pay me back someday.

00:13:49.706 --> 00:13:53.577
‐ You got it. Whatever I can do,
consider it done.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.483
‐ I think I know
how you can pay me back.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.751
Next time Elza Kanzaki plays,

00:14:00.817 --> 00:14:02.453
get us the best seats
in the house.

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:03.820
‐ [sputters]

00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:07.591
I should have known
you'd pick something hard.

00:14:14.065 --> 00:14:15.732
‐ All right, I'm ready.

00:14:17.534 --> 00:14:19.870
Here I come, Pito.

00:14:19.936 --> 00:14:21.605
‐ And with that...

00:14:21.672 --> 00:14:24.575
it's time to get my freak on.

00:14:27.678 --> 00:14:30.447
One more spoonful
for good luck.

00:14:32.083 --> 00:14:35.852
Announcer: Attention, players!
Today at 1300 hours,

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:38.555
we'll be hosting
the second Squad Jam!

00:14:38.622 --> 00:14:40.724
Watch 30 teams go head‐to‐head

00:14:40.791 --> 00:14:42.959
in the wildest
battle royale ever.

00:14:43.027 --> 00:14:44.195
Who will survive?

00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:46.930
Keep your eyes peeled
to our feed to find out.

00:14:46.997 --> 00:14:47.998
LLENN: Oh, come on!

00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:51.202
"Crap. The ice cream I ate
upset my stomach."

00:14:51.268 --> 00:14:53.070
So when can you get here?

00:14:53.137 --> 00:14:55.039
‐ "Stomach still rumbling."

00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:55.906
Would you hurry?!

00:14:55.972 --> 00:14:58.509
"Okay, I'm wiping my butt now."

00:14:58.575 --> 00:15:00.477
"Oh, no,
I'm out of toilet paper!"

00:15:00.544 --> 00:15:03.647
I don't care!
Just dive in already!

00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:08.519
‐ Try your luck,
and guess how many shots

00:15:08.585 --> 00:15:10.287
will be fired
during the tournament.

00:15:10.354 --> 00:15:12.489
Only 500 credits per guess.

00:15:12.556 --> 00:15:14.491
‐ Check it out.
‐ Whoa.

00:15:14.558 --> 00:15:16.293
‐ [crowd murmuring]
‐ There they are.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.496
‐ It's team Memento Mori.

00:15:19.563 --> 00:15:21.798
‐ If I had the credits,
I'd bet on them.

00:15:21.865 --> 00:15:24.701
‐ Yeah, me, too. They're
the strongest team on the board.

00:15:24.768 --> 00:15:27.671
‐ Yeah, but last time,
team SHINC came in second.

00:15:27.738 --> 00:15:31.308
‐ Damn, they look down to kill.

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:33.310
David: How's it going, ladies?

00:15:33.377 --> 00:15:34.778
The team and I
are looking forward

00:15:34.845 --> 00:15:36.713
to meeting up with you
out there on the map.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.316
Just make sure
you don't die early.

00:15:39.383 --> 00:15:41.118
‐ Don't worry. We won't.

00:15:41.185 --> 00:15:42.719
And if you guys don't mind,

00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:45.689
we'd like to get all your names
before we go head‐to‐head

00:15:45.756 --> 00:15:48.125
so we know what to put
on your tombstones.

00:15:48.192 --> 00:15:50.527
‐ This is gonna be fun.

00:15:50.594 --> 00:15:52.129
I can't wait to start.

00:15:52.196 --> 00:15:55.332
‐ [chuckles] I've never
seen anyone so eager to die.

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:56.867
‐ Look who's here.

00:15:56.933 --> 00:15:59.336
[crowd cheering]

00:15:59.403 --> 00:16:01.938
David: So the big guy signed up.

00:16:02.006 --> 00:16:03.507
Perfect.

00:16:03.574 --> 00:16:05.709
This time,
we'll be ready for him.

00:16:05.776 --> 00:16:06.543
‐ Yup.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.279
Man: Who are they?

00:16:08.345 --> 00:16:09.746
Man #2: Yeah, and why the masks?

00:16:09.813 --> 00:16:11.748
Man #3:
Guess they roll incognito.

00:16:11.815 --> 00:16:13.284
Man #4: Maybe they
don't want anyone

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.152
to recognize them from B.o.B.

00:16:15.219 --> 00:16:17.154
‐ Hey! [laughs]

00:16:17.221 --> 00:16:21.625
Sorry to keep y'all waiting.
Hi there! Oh, I know you.

00:16:21.692 --> 00:16:24.595
Show of hands, who's here today
to watch me slay?

00:16:24.661 --> 00:16:26.963
I know. I'm late,
and I'm so sorry about that.

00:16:27.031 --> 00:16:30.734
Thanks for your support, though.
Love ya! Mwah!

00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:32.969
Man #4: The hell was that about?

00:16:33.037 --> 00:16:35.272
Man #3: She acts like
she's some kinda princess.

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:38.575
Man #5: Then I guess
those goons must be her knights.

00:16:38.642 --> 00:16:41.578
David: Crap.
Of all the people...

00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:43.447
‐ You know her?
‐ Yeah.

00:16:43.514 --> 00:16:45.749
We were on the same team
for a little while.

00:16:45.816 --> 00:16:48.385
It was just after G.G.O.
first went live.

00:16:48.452 --> 00:16:51.922
She didn't have the tats then,
and her hair was short

00:16:51.988 --> 00:16:54.791
so it wouldn't get
in her face in a fight.

00:16:54.858 --> 00:16:57.028
‐ How come you never
mentioned her before?

00:16:57.094 --> 00:16:59.930
‐ Wasn't important. Those days,
I rocked a shitty gun

00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:01.698
and couldn't fight
worth a damn.

00:17:01.765 --> 00:17:03.367
Good times back then.

00:17:03.434 --> 00:17:05.136
‐ Dude, you sound
like my grandpa.

00:17:05.202 --> 00:17:08.439
‐ If you were having fun,
why'd you quit playing with her?

00:17:08.505 --> 00:17:09.673
Was she a drag?

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.875
‐ No, she was a good player,

00:17:11.942 --> 00:17:15.179
fearless. She had great moves.

00:17:15.246 --> 00:17:18.482
She was hard‐core
into full‐dive VR games.

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:21.652
‐ Sounds perfect for you.
You should have stuck with her.

00:17:21.718 --> 00:17:23.487
‐ No way.
‐ Why?

00:17:23.554 --> 00:17:28.259
‐ 'Cause she thought everyone
on the team was expendable.

00:17:28.325 --> 00:17:32.029
She'd use you for a shield
or toss a grenade at a monster,

00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:34.965
even if you were standing
next to it. She didn't care.

00:17:35.032 --> 00:17:38.702
She'd smile if someone
on the team got killed

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:41.872
or if she did. Creepy.

00:17:41.938 --> 00:17:45.376
I don't wanna play with someone
who's got a death wish.

00:17:45.442 --> 00:17:48.212
I'm Memento Mori.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:50.981
I live my life
knowing I'm gonna die someday.

00:17:51.048 --> 00:17:52.783
But that freak show? [chuckles]

00:17:52.849 --> 00:17:55.086
She lives hers
like she's hoping to die.

00:17:55.152 --> 00:17:58.189
‐ That is creepy.
No wonder you bailed.

00:17:58.255 --> 00:18:01.092
‐ I heard she quit that team
and joined another

00:18:01.158 --> 00:18:03.194
and pulled the same crap
with them.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.130
Word got around,
and no one wanted her,

00:18:06.197 --> 00:18:08.399
so she went solo.

00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:11.402
Summon: If that's true,
then why's she with M?

00:18:11.468 --> 00:18:12.603
‐ Beats me.

00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:15.139
But I wouldn't
let your guard down.

00:18:15.206 --> 00:18:18.609
Chances are everyone on that
team's just as crazy as she is.

00:18:18.675 --> 00:18:19.810
‐ [team grumbling]

00:18:19.876 --> 00:18:22.679
‐ Pitohui.
‐ Huh?

00:18:22.746 --> 00:18:25.082
‐ It's a bird you can
only find in New Guinea.

00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:30.621
Its skin and feathers are
poisonous to animals and humans.

00:18:30.687 --> 00:18:34.691
Pitohui's
a perfect name for her.

00:18:34.758 --> 00:18:36.360
[overlapping chatter]

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:45.669
‐ Yo, dudes, I just realized

00:18:45.736 --> 00:18:47.204
that teeny pink girl's
not here yet.

00:18:47.271 --> 00:18:49.606
‐ She better hurry.
It starts in two.

00:18:49.673 --> 00:18:51.608
‐ I hope she
didn't change her mind.

00:18:51.675 --> 00:18:52.976
‐ Where is she?

00:18:54.545 --> 00:18:55.612
[running footsteps]

‐ [crowd murmuring]
‐ [both panting]

00:18:59.583 --> 00:19:01.585
‐ Talk about cutting it close.

00:19:01.652 --> 00:19:04.421
‐ I told you
we'd make it here in time.

00:19:04.488 --> 00:19:06.423
‐ [cheering]

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.858
Man: She made it!

00:19:07.924 --> 00:19:09.293
Man #2: LLENN's here
to tear it up!

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.428
Man #3: Ah, she's playing
a two‐person team again.

00:19:11.495 --> 00:19:14.798
‐ Get out there, and show us
a good old‐fashioned massacre!

00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:17.301
‐ Smells like her partner's
a girl, too.

00:19:17.368 --> 00:19:18.669
I love this skill.

00:19:18.735 --> 00:19:20.637
‐ Where the hell'd
you get a smell skill?

00:19:20.704 --> 00:19:22.739
‐ Hey, do we still
have time to get a drink?

00:19:22.806 --> 00:19:25.809
‐ What are you talking about?
You'll just get the runs again.

00:19:25.876 --> 00:19:27.044
‐ Nah, I'll be fine.

00:19:27.111 --> 00:19:28.845
My stomach's
totally empty right now.

00:19:28.912 --> 00:19:31.048
‐ How's it going, LLENN?

00:19:31.115 --> 00:19:34.251
Congrats on winning
the last tourney, girl. [laughs]

00:19:34.318 --> 00:19:36.287
‐ Thanks a lot, Pito.

00:19:40.324 --> 00:19:42.693
‐ We'll see
how you do this time.

00:19:46.363 --> 00:19:49.633
Announcer: Last call for all
you Squad Jammers out there.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.302
It's almost time to start.

00:19:51.368 --> 00:19:54.905
Make sure everyone on your team
is ready to be teleported.

00:19:54.971 --> 00:19:57.974
In 30 seconds, we'll send you
to the standby area.

00:19:58.042 --> 00:19:59.843
‐ Oh, darn it, I was hoping

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.678
we'd have more time
to catch up.

00:20:01.745 --> 00:20:03.347
‐ Hey, Pito.
‐ Huh?

00:20:03.414 --> 00:20:06.683
‐ I just want you to know
I'll be fighting to win today,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.087
and if I do win,
you have to keep your promise.

00:20:10.154 --> 00:20:11.755
‐ Hmm?

00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:13.890
Not sure what you mean,
but okay.

00:20:13.957 --> 00:20:15.292
If you win, remind me.

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:17.928
There's no need to get
all aggro about it.

00:20:17.994 --> 00:20:19.896
Anything else you wanna say?

00:20:19.963 --> 00:20:22.499
‐ I'll kill you. I swear.

00:20:22.566 --> 00:20:24.501
‐ [laughs]

00:20:24.568 --> 00:20:25.502
[sighs]

00:20:28.639 --> 00:20:30.307
‐ Let's go, partner.

00:20:30.374 --> 00:20:32.176
‐ You got it, partner.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.782
Announcer: Just a reminder,
in this Squad Jam,

00:20:38.849 --> 00:20:41.252
your Terminal is
not an Immortal Object.

00:20:41.318 --> 00:20:44.588
Keep that in mind,
and good luck out there.

00:20:44.655 --> 00:20:46.557
‐ Time to get our gear on.

00:20:46.623 --> 00:20:48.125
‐ Roger that.

00:20:57.601 --> 00:21:01.005
Kick ass, Rightony, Leftania.

00:21:01.072 --> 00:21:02.239
‐ What'd you say?

00:21:02.306 --> 00:21:03.940
‐ Those are the names
I gave to 'em.

00:21:04.008 --> 00:21:05.676
‐ They both look
exactly the same,

00:21:05.742 --> 00:21:09.146
so how do you know which is
Rightony and which is Leftania?

00:21:09.213 --> 00:21:12.816
‐ Oh, I got that all worked out.
When they're both equipped,

00:21:12.883 --> 00:21:14.751
the one
in my right hand's Rightony.

00:21:14.818 --> 00:21:16.253
‐ Wow, that's clever.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.755
‐ I wonder what kinda guns
everyone else is packing.

00:21:18.822 --> 00:21:21.158
‐ I don't know,
but I'm sure M's gonna be using

00:21:21.225 --> 00:21:23.694
the same rifle and shield
as he did last time.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.062
‐ How about Pito?

00:21:25.129 --> 00:21:27.398
‐ I don't know
what kinda gun she'll have.

00:21:27.464 --> 00:21:30.467
Every time I played with her,
she had something different.

00:21:30.534 --> 00:21:33.837
My guess is she'll be using
something pretty wicked.

00:21:33.904 --> 00:21:35.306
‐ How 'bout the others with her?

00:21:35.372 --> 00:21:37.274
‐ I don't know about those four,

00:21:37.341 --> 00:21:39.843
but they won't stop me
getting to her.

00:21:41.312 --> 00:21:42.213
‐ [chuckles]

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:44.081
Hey, as long
as no one else kills her,

00:21:44.148 --> 00:21:46.150
she won't kill herself
in real life.

00:21:46.217 --> 00:21:48.252
And who knows? She might win.

00:21:48.319 --> 00:21:50.087
‐ Yeah, maybe.

00:21:53.357 --> 00:21:54.391
[squeals]

‐ No more doubts!

00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:01.598
I got this.

00:22:02.966 --> 00:22:06.103
Watch out, Pito. I'm coming.
