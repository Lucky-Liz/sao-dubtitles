WEBVTT

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:03.975
Pito: Happy New Year, LLENN!

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.243
LLENN: Happy New Year!

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.379
‐ So, LLENN, I was
wondering about something.

00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:09.915
Have you heard about Squad Jam?

00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:11.282
‐ Did you say, "Squid jam"?

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.952
‐ Ecch!
Now I'm picturing that. Gross.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.788
‐ What's gross about it?
It's just fermented squid paste.

00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:19.925
‐ That's not what
I'm talking about!

00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:22.493
You thought I said, "Squid,"
but I didn't.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.862
I said, "Squad." You know,

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.064
like a group of soldiers
on a mission?

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:27.632
‐ But you also said, "Jam."

00:00:27.698 --> 00:00:29.600
‐ Not the kind
you spread on bread.

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:32.871
I meant "jam" like, jamming
a bunch of things together.

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:35.440
‐ Oh, like bullets
jammed in a gun.

00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:38.143
So then, Squad Jam is
just a bunch of squads.

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:41.046
‐ That's right. Squad Jam's
this tournament coming up,

00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:42.247
where a bunch of teams

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:44.515
get to fight it out
in a battle royale.

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.084
[billiard balls clatter]

00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:21.915
Pito: Squad Jam's
also called "S.J."

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:24.284
‐ And it's
literally a battle royale,

00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:26.419
where everyone fights
each other to the death?

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:28.855
‐ Yup. You ever hear
about something

00:02:28.922 --> 00:02:30.790
called Bullet of Bullets, LLENN?

00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:32.659
It also goes by the name B.o.B.

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:35.095
‐ I only know
the basics about it.

00:02:35.162 --> 00:02:39.032
There's a one‐on‐one prelim
to find the top 30 players.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.934
Then they fight
'til only one's left.

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.471
The survivor gets the title
of strongest player in G.G.O.

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:45.705
That's it, though.

00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:48.041
‐ The third one was held
not too long ago,

00:02:48.108 --> 00:02:49.442
and I was in it.

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:51.244
‐ Whoa! So how'd you do?

00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:54.514
‐ I only made it
to the second round of prelims.

00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:55.916
‐ Oh. That sucks.

00:02:55.983 --> 00:02:59.452
‐ Yeah, a sniper got me.
Chalk it up to bad luck.

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.522
Anyway, something really cool
happened in the finals.

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:06.359
Two players worked together as
a team right up until the end.

00:03:06.426 --> 00:03:07.961
You should have seen it.

00:03:08.028 --> 00:03:11.231
God, what a blast!
Talk about intense.

00:03:11.298 --> 00:03:13.934
The whole time,
I was on the edge of my seat.

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:17.170
So this guy from Japan
was watching the last B.o.B.,

00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:20.573
and he thought it was so cool,
he got this crazy idea.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.409
He thought,
"How 'bout a battle royale,

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:24.111
but with teams
going at it instead?"

00:03:24.177 --> 00:03:25.112
‐ Hmm.

00:03:25.178 --> 00:03:27.547
‐ He DMed ZASKAR,
the folks that created

00:03:27.614 --> 00:03:29.749
and operate G.G.O.,
about it, and here we are.

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:33.520
‐ Wait. they granted
the request of some rando?

00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:34.821
‐ Well, that's what happened.

00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:36.256
He even offered to sponsor it,

00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:39.192
so ZASKAR had nothing to lose
at the end of the day.

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.429
Aw, man. Setting this up must
have cost him a pretty penny.

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:43.997
The guy's a writer in his 50s

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:46.199
who's got
this insane fixation for guns.

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:47.334
He loves 'em so much,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.103
he's got shooting
going on in all his books.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.038
[writer chuckles]

00:03:51.104 --> 00:03:54.908
‐ Huh. Sounds like
an eccentric guy.

00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:58.045
‐ Hah! He's both a writer
and a gun nut.

00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:59.879
He's way beyond eccentric.

00:03:59.947 --> 00:04:02.149
I say, if we see him
out in public,

00:04:02.215 --> 00:04:05.152
we scream bloody murder 'til
the cops show up and nail him.

00:04:05.218 --> 00:04:07.787
‐ It sounds like you got
a grudge against him, Pito.

00:04:07.854 --> 00:04:09.756
‐ No, not really.

00:04:09.822 --> 00:04:13.726
Anyway, the folks at ZASKAR
liked his idea, and since

00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:15.795
he was gonna be the one
bankrolling the whole thing,

00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:18.031
they said, "What the heck?"
and agreed to go ahead

00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:20.567
and do it as a mini‐tourney
on the Japanese server.

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:23.503
They called it Squad Jam,
"S.J.", for short.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.139
The sign‐ups for teams
are going on right this minute.

00:04:26.206 --> 00:04:29.676
It's gonna happen next Sunday,
February the first.

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:33.846
‐ Hopefully they get
enough players for it.

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:35.648
‐ Want one?
‐ No, thanks.

00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:36.816
It's a quick turnaround,

00:04:36.883 --> 00:04:38.685
but a bunch of teams
already signed up.

00:04:38.751 --> 00:04:41.788
Pretty sure
none of the B.o.B. finalists

00:04:41.854 --> 00:04:43.323
are gonna be
in the mix for this one.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.259
I have a feeling
they all prefer playing solo.

00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:47.794
‐ [crunching] Hmm.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.062
Their loss, I guess.

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.598
‐ What's up?
You're not into this?

00:04:51.664 --> 00:04:53.733
‐ Sorry, but I'm
not really cut out

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.903
for these player‐versus‐player
tournaments.

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:57.704
‐ That's hilarious,
considering you're one

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.639
of the most ruthless assassins
in this game.

00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:00.640
‐ I‐I'm not ruthless!

00:05:00.707 --> 00:05:02.875
‐ Yeah, right. Whatever.

00:05:02.943 --> 00:05:05.412
Sign up.
You'd be so awesome at it.

00:05:05.478 --> 00:05:07.580
‐ Who, me?! For real?

00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:09.116
You like, wanna team up?

00:05:09.182 --> 00:05:11.851
‐ No. As much as I'd like
to take part in the bloodbath,

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.186
I'll have to sit this one out.

00:05:13.253 --> 00:05:15.055
My best friend
since middle school's

00:05:15.122 --> 00:05:17.257
getting married
the same day as the tourney.

00:05:17.324 --> 00:05:20.093
If I skipped her wedding
to go blast a bunch of people

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.062
in a game,
she'd never forgive me.

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.697
It wouldn't matter
if I survived and won.

00:05:24.764 --> 00:05:26.799
‐ She'd kill you for sure
in real life.

00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:28.035
‐ You know it.

00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:30.103
But you're not
doing anything that day,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.871
nothing important,
like a friend's wedding,

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.206
or your wedding, right?

00:05:33.273 --> 00:05:34.674
‐ Maybe?

00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:36.809
I'd have to check my calendar.

00:05:36.876 --> 00:05:37.945
‐ I so knew it!

00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:39.279
I'll take care
of signing you up.

00:05:39.346 --> 00:05:41.848
‐ H‐Hold on!
I didn't say I would.

00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:43.716
Besides, I have to be on a team.

00:05:43.783 --> 00:05:45.818
Who can I team up with
besides you?

00:05:45.885 --> 00:05:47.587
‐ Hah! I knew you were into it.

00:05:47.654 --> 00:05:49.222
‐ I was just asking.

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.126
‐ I happen to know a player
who'd be perfect for you.

00:05:53.193 --> 00:05:56.429
He's super talented,
but a little on the weird side.

00:05:56.496 --> 00:05:58.198
Actually,
he's pretty much a criminal,

00:05:58.265 --> 00:06:00.133
if you wanna
get right down to it.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.202
I wouldn't call him
a bad guy, though.

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:03.937
He's not exactly good, either.

00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:06.873
You guys are gonna make
an awesome team together.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.775
‐ Wait. Just him and me?

00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.410
‐ Yup, just you guys.

00:06:10.477 --> 00:06:13.546
I had others in mind,
but they're all busy, too.

00:06:13.613 --> 00:06:15.048
‐ Honestly...

00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:16.516
after hearing you say all that,

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:18.818
do you think I'd be okay
teaming up with him?!

00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:20.988
‐ New experiences
are good for you.

00:06:21.054 --> 00:06:23.423
‐ You're right,
but I don't know.

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:29.029
‐ LLENN, be honest with me
for a sec here.

00:06:29.096 --> 00:06:31.131
I get the feeling
something's bugging you.

00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:33.700
‐ Huh?
‐ If I were to guess,

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:37.204
I'd say something in your
real life's got you down.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.006
That's why you play G.G.O.,

00:06:39.072 --> 00:06:41.341
to blow off a little steam.
Am I right?

00:06:41.408 --> 00:06:43.710
You're here,
'cause you wanna escape.

00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:45.212
‐ [gasps]

00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:49.416
‐ I know what you're thinking,
how'd I know?

00:06:49.482 --> 00:06:51.051
It's simple, really.

00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:54.221
I'm here for the same reason.

00:06:54.287 --> 00:06:57.290
There's all kinds of stuff
in my real life that I hate

00:06:57.357 --> 00:07:00.260
or can't do anything about,
but here in G.G.O.,

00:07:00.327 --> 00:07:03.063
I get to unload
on monsters and people

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.432
and kill the hell out of them
with no regrets.

00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:07.600
‐ "No regrets."

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:09.669
‐ Mm.
‐ [boom]

00:07:09.736 --> 00:07:10.971
[gasps]

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.841
‐ [running footsteps]
‐ All I'm saying is,

00:07:14.908 --> 00:07:17.077
this game lets us take out
all our frustrations

00:07:17.144 --> 00:07:19.312
in ways we can't
in the real world.

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:20.981
[monster roars]

00:07:22.082 --> 00:07:24.584
So let's cut loose
and kick some ass!

00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:26.086
[monster roars]

00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:28.621
If I don't hear from you
by Wednesday morning,

00:07:28.688 --> 00:07:29.957
I'm signing you up!

00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:30.991
‐ I didn't say I would!

00:07:31.058 --> 00:07:32.892
‐ Sorry! I can't hear you!

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.761
‐ 'Cause you don't want to!

00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:37.630
‐ Blow its rotten face off!
‐ [gunfire]

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:43.904
Miyu: No way. This Squad Jam
thing's a PvP with teams?!

00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:45.538
That sounds awesome!

00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:47.340
‐ Mm, yeah, well...

00:07:47.407 --> 00:07:50.010
I'm not sure about
picking fights with people.

00:07:50.077 --> 00:07:51.511
That's kind of scary.

00:07:51.578 --> 00:07:55.282
And I don't know about
teaming up with some stranger,

00:07:55.348 --> 00:07:57.250
even if Pito vouches for him.

00:07:58.485 --> 00:07:59.252
Part of me worries

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.054
I'll just be in his way.

00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:04.024
Anyhoo, that's why
I'm calling you.

00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:05.792
Since you're
the big VR expert,

00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:08.061
what would you do
if you were in my shoes?

00:08:08.128 --> 00:08:09.829
‐ I think if you think
it'd be fun,

00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:11.264
you should totally do it.

00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:14.201
‐ Uh, that's the problem.
I don't know.

00:08:14.267 --> 00:08:15.903
‐ Whoa! Hang on a sec.

00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:17.470
I just looked it up,

00:08:17.537 --> 00:08:19.806
and Squad Jam's
happening February 1!

00:08:19.872 --> 00:08:21.274
‐ Yeah. So?

00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:24.544
‐ Elza Kanzaki's concert's
that day. Remember?

00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:26.546
I told you I'd try
to get tickets for us.

00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:29.882
‐ [gasps] I totally forgot.
I'm sorry.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.953
If we can still get tickets
to it, I'd rather go to that.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.521
And you can stay over
and stuff, too.

00:08:34.587 --> 00:08:38.058
‐ Cool! But what if we
can't get tickets to it?

00:08:39.526 --> 00:08:42.930
Mm, this point,
our chances are fifty‐fifty.

00:08:42.996 --> 00:08:44.831
‐ When will you know
you got 'em?

00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:46.533
‐ 4:00 Tuesday.

00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:49.269
‐ If you can get 'em, I'm not
gonna do the tournament.

00:08:49.336 --> 00:08:51.939
Let me know
as soon as you find out.

00:08:55.708 --> 00:08:57.110
"The rules for Squad Jam

00:08:57.177 --> 00:09:00.113
are basically the same
as B.o.B.'s battle royale.

00:09:01.014 --> 00:09:02.482
The match begins when the teams

00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:04.351
are teleported
to the playing field.

00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:07.387
The team that survives
to the end wins.

00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:10.623
The setting is a special map.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.925
Teleportation is random,

00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:13.693
so where teams start
depends on luck.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.897
Players may use any weapon
they please during battle.

00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:21.068
They may also use
any vehicle they find.

00:09:21.134 --> 00:09:23.436
Corpses usually disappear
right away,

00:09:23.503 --> 00:09:27.007
but in S.J., they will remain
on the map for ten minutes.

00:09:27.908 --> 00:09:29.509
The Satellite Scan.

00:09:29.576 --> 00:09:31.644
Each player
will receive a terminal,

00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.781
which will periodically display
their opponents' locations

00:09:34.847 --> 00:09:36.449
for a short time."

00:09:36.516 --> 00:09:38.618
Huh.

00:09:38.685 --> 00:09:40.687
[groans]

[clock chiming]

00:09:46.195 --> 00:09:48.530
‐ Please let me get
a ticket to see Elza.

00:09:48.597 --> 00:09:50.933
Please, please, please.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.634
‐ [girls chattering]
‐ [groans]

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:05.580
Girl: You see her?

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:06.815
‐ Yeah, how could I not?

00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:09.018
‐ She's so tall.

00:10:09.084 --> 00:10:11.987
[cell phone rings]

00:10:12.054 --> 00:10:13.522
Miyu: I'm sorry, Kohi.

00:10:13.588 --> 00:10:16.125
I couldn't get tickets
to Elza's concert.

00:10:17.026 --> 00:10:18.160
‐ That's okay.

00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:19.995
Guess I can play now.

00:10:20.062 --> 00:10:22.464
Thanks for trying
to get them. Bye.

00:10:25.234 --> 00:10:27.769
‐ So let's cut loose
and kick some ass!

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.338
‐ [gasps]

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.280
[thinking]
I'll kick ass, all right.

00:10:38.347 --> 00:10:39.748
[country western music playing]

[glasses clinking]

00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:44.353
Pito: Yoo‐hoo! LLENN!

00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:46.922
I got us a private room up here!

00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:48.657
I knew I could count on you.

00:10:48.723 --> 00:10:50.359
You're gonna slay out there,
literally!

00:10:50.425 --> 00:10:52.627
Ow! Take it easy, Pito! [groans]

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.230
‐ So, about your partner
in this thing,

00:10:55.297 --> 00:10:57.766
I asked him to run some errands
for me in real life,

00:10:57.832 --> 00:10:59.234
and he'll be a little late.

00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:02.704
‐ She knows him in real life,
too. Interesting.

00:11:02.771 --> 00:11:07.309
Is he her boyfriend, lover,
husband, maybe her dad?

00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:09.211
Heck, he could even be her son.

00:11:09.278 --> 00:11:12.114
‐ Did you bone up
on the rules of S.J. last night?

00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:14.583
Knowing you, I bet
you stayed up super late

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:15.617
going over every word.

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:17.019
‐ Y‐Yeah.

00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:18.353
‐ Then how 'bout you and I

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.355
go over
the most important points of S.J.?

00:11:20.422 --> 00:11:22.992
Teams can have
from two to six players,

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:24.326
no more, no less.

00:11:24.393 --> 00:11:26.395
If you shoot
your teammate by mistake

00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:28.097
or they get hit
by friendly fire,

00:11:28.163 --> 00:11:29.864
their HP will take damage.

00:11:29.932 --> 00:11:31.700
Unlike in B.o.B.,

00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:34.636
you can communicate
with your team here.

00:11:34.703 --> 00:11:36.638
You can't communicate
with other teams.

00:11:36.705 --> 00:11:39.208
Corpses stay on the map
for ten minutes

00:11:39.274 --> 00:11:41.043
and then return
to the saloon.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.444
At the start of the game,

00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:45.014
all teams are dropped
at least one kilometer apart,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.217
but they can
close in on you quick,
so always be on guard.

00:11:48.283 --> 00:11:51.686
Snipers can pop your bubble
from 800 meters,

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:55.224
and a machine gun can
ventilate you from 600 meters.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.393
There's one thing about S.J.
to always keep in mind.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.195
Get ready to answer this one.

00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:03.265
The Sat Scan only shows
where the team leader is,

00:12:03.332 --> 00:12:05.367
which means...

00:12:05.434 --> 00:12:07.702
‐ Um...
‐ Yes. LLENN.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:11.240
‐ There's no way to tell where
a team's members really are

00:12:11.306 --> 00:12:13.375
unless you have
a visual on them,

00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:16.178
which means you can use
your team leader's position

00:12:16.245 --> 00:12:17.312
to set a trap?

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:18.480
‐ That's my LLENN,

00:12:18.547 --> 00:12:20.983
as sneaky as an ant lion
in the Sahara!

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.217
You ruthless little bug.

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:23.885
‐ Please don't tease me
like that.

00:12:23.953 --> 00:12:25.354
‐ Who's teasing?

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.023
The way you pop out at players,
spraying bullets,

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.291
God, you're vicious!

00:12:29.358 --> 00:12:31.260
‐ It gives me the chills.
‐ Question!

00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:32.761
‐ Yes! LLENN!

00:12:32.827 --> 00:12:36.065
‐ What happens if a team's
leader dies? Do they lose?

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.667
‐ That wouldn't be fun
for the others, now, would it?

00:12:38.733 --> 00:12:41.770
During registration, you give
each team member a rank.

00:12:41.836 --> 00:12:44.974
If the leader dies,
the next rank takes their place.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.308
‐ That's perfect.

00:12:46.375 --> 00:12:48.243
It's one less thing
for everyone on the team

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.744
to worry about
during all the shooting.

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.746
‐ Yup, you said it.
Focus on the fight.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:54.649
It'd be so cool if
the two of you win this thing.

00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:58.320
‐ [sighs] I can't believe
I'm doing this.

00:12:58.387 --> 00:13:00.489
‐ There's one last rule
to keep in mind.

00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:02.457
The leader's
the only one who can resign,

00:13:02.524 --> 00:13:04.593
and if that happens,
the whole team's out, too.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:07.262
But I'm pretty sure
that's not going to be an option

00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:09.098
either of you are gonna go for.

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.565
‐ Hmm.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.268
‐ Well, that's everything.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.337
‐ Good luck, squad leader!
‐ [gasps]

00:13:15.404 --> 00:13:17.172
What do you mean
I'm the leader?

00:13:17.239 --> 00:13:19.608
I‐I can't be the leader.
What's up?

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:22.344
Is the person you're
sticking me with weaker than me?

00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:24.914
‐ You're so cute
when you get all frazzled.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.548
He's not weaker than you.

00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:29.251
Seriously, he's
the strongest player I know.

00:13:29.318 --> 00:13:30.785
‐ Then why me?

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:31.987
‐ Trust me girl, okay?

00:13:32.054 --> 00:13:33.688
‐ It's all part of the plan.
‐ [door opens]

00:13:33.755 --> 00:13:34.889
‐ M: I'm here.
‐ [gasps]

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:38.693
‐ Sorry I'm late.

00:13:40.264 --> 00:13:42.099
Pito: Yeah,
you'd better be sorry.

00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:43.667
‐ The traffic was bad.

00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:46.303
I did get everything
you wanted done, though.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.571
‐ Meet your new partner.

00:13:47.638 --> 00:13:49.573
As you can see,
he's big as a house

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.108
and has
poor time‐management skills,

00:13:51.175 --> 00:13:53.244
but he's one hell of a fighter.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.046
Go on, doofus.
Introduce yourself.

00:13:55.112 --> 00:13:57.814
‐ How's it going?
Name's M, like the letter.

00:13:57.881 --> 00:13:58.882
Nice to meet you.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.651
‐ Nice to meet you, too.

00:14:00.717 --> 00:14:02.653
You can call me LLENN. [gasps]

00:14:02.719 --> 00:14:04.588
‐ Sorry to duck out on you kids.

00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:06.924
Have fun, and don't
do anything I wouldn't do.

00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:08.625
‐ Uh...
‐ Bye!

00:14:08.692 --> 00:14:10.861
‐ [door closes]
‐ [sighs]

00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:13.697
‐ So, uh...
‐ [yelps]

00:14:13.764 --> 00:14:16.000
it's obvious we're both
nervous about this,

00:14:16.067 --> 00:14:19.670
but, like, let's not be.
You know, nervous.

00:14:19.736 --> 00:14:21.505
I don't want
Pito kicking my ass

00:14:21.572 --> 00:14:23.840
'cause I made you
so nervous that we lost.

00:14:23.908 --> 00:14:25.309
‐ You're kidding.

00:14:25.376 --> 00:14:27.778
I‐I mean, mm‐hmm!
I totally get it.

00:14:27.844 --> 00:14:29.546
But you don't have
to worry about me,

00:14:29.613 --> 00:14:32.183
'cause I'm going to give it
my all and then some!

00:14:32.249 --> 00:14:33.650
I'm rarin' to go, M.

00:14:33.717 --> 00:14:37.354
‐ Me, too. Let's do our best
out there, LLENN.

00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:39.490
Is it okay I call you that,

00:14:39.556 --> 00:14:41.892
instead of, you know, "Captain"?

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:43.294
It'll help me relax.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.229
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Thanks for understanding.

00:14:45.296 --> 00:14:46.830
So what were you talking about?

00:14:46.897 --> 00:14:48.865
‐ She went over
the rules with me

00:14:48.933 --> 00:14:51.602
and said I was the leader,
but wouldn't tell me why.

00:14:51.668 --> 00:14:55.139
‐ And did she tell you why
she wanted us to meet today?

00:14:55.206 --> 00:14:56.473
‐ No, she didn't.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.176
‐ [sighs] That figures.

00:14:59.243 --> 00:15:00.277
Let's go.

00:15:00.344 --> 00:15:02.346
‐ What do you mean? Go where?

00:15:02.413 --> 00:15:04.581
‐ The training grounds.

00:15:05.782 --> 00:15:08.485
I want to check out
your combat skills.

00:15:08.552 --> 00:15:11.255
We'll start with you
in stand‐up firing position.

00:15:11.322 --> 00:15:13.991
Now fire ten rounds
on semi‐auto.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.396
Now fire ten more,
fast as you can,

00:15:19.463 --> 00:15:21.365
the rest on full‐auto.

00:15:24.035 --> 00:15:24.868
[LLENN panting]

00:15:24.936 --> 00:15:27.204
‐ Sprint full speed
to the truck.

00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:30.474
Touch it. Then run back
at full speed.

00:15:30.541 --> 00:15:32.009
Aim for the target
while you're running,

00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:33.077
and fire on full auto.

00:15:34.578 --> 00:15:39.116
When you're down to
eight rounds, reload and fire.

00:15:39.183 --> 00:15:40.117
[gunfire fades]

00:15:40.184 --> 00:15:41.718
Now walk with your eyes closed,

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:44.121
straight ahead,
steady pace, even steps.

00:15:44.188 --> 00:15:47.224
Stop, turn to your right,
and find your target.

00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:49.326
On my command, get up, and run.

00:15:49.393 --> 00:15:50.494
Go!

00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:53.230
When I signal, hit the dirt!

00:15:53.297 --> 00:15:55.666
Now walk backwards
as fast as you can.

00:15:55.732 --> 00:15:57.534
‐ [yelps]
‐ If you trip and fall,

00:15:57.601 --> 00:15:59.003
get in the prone position.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.773
Scrunch up into a ball, and roll
straight down the slope.

00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:05.742
‐ [groans]

00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:08.745
‐ I have a good idea
of your skills now.

00:16:08.812 --> 00:16:11.448
‐ Whoa, that's what you use?

00:16:11.515 --> 00:16:14.151
I've never seen a rifle
like that before.

00:16:14.218 --> 00:16:15.953
‐ It's the M14‐EBR.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.790
The EBR stands
for Enhanced Battle Rifle.

00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:22.793
It's a souped‐up version
of the standard M14,

00:16:22.859 --> 00:16:25.429
7.62 caliber.

00:16:25.496 --> 00:16:27.431
‐ I guess that means
your combat style's

00:16:27.498 --> 00:16:29.900
what they call midrange,
semi‐auto?

00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:32.636
‐ You got it.
I like to keep as much distance

00:16:32.703 --> 00:16:34.771
between me and the enemy
as possible.

00:16:34.838 --> 00:16:37.241
I'll use the EBR
up close if I have to,

00:16:37.308 --> 00:16:39.776
but if I'm in a room,
I use this.

00:16:40.644 --> 00:16:42.914
This is the HK45.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.382
It's German made, .45 caliber.

00:16:45.449 --> 00:16:46.951
It holds ten rounds in the mag.

00:16:47.018 --> 00:16:49.886
Push this up,
and the safety's on.

00:16:49.954 --> 00:16:52.823
Remember that, in case
you need to use it someday.

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:56.093
‐ I got it.
Lever up, safety's on.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.695
‐ You have any questions?

00:16:58.762 --> 00:17:02.533
‐ Um, why do you want me
to be team leader?

00:17:02.599 --> 00:17:04.168
‐ It's a strategy.

00:17:04.235 --> 00:17:07.004
During play, I'll be
the one giving the orders.

00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:11.742
‐ That backpack's huge.
Wonder what's in there.

00:17:11.808 --> 00:17:13.911

00:17:15.212 --> 00:17:18.515
Karen: Dear Elza Kanzaki,

00:17:18.582 --> 00:17:21.685
this is my first time
writing a fan letter.

00:17:21.752 --> 00:17:24.788
I love all your songs
and think you have

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:27.658
one of the most soothing voices
I have ever heard.

00:17:27.724 --> 00:17:31.595
It helps me forget
what a drag my life can be.

00:17:32.563 --> 00:17:34.966
I'm unusually tall for a girl.

00:17:35.032 --> 00:17:36.800
I've had
sort of a complex about it

00:17:36.867 --> 00:17:38.702
ever since I was a little kid.

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:40.137
‐ ♪ Tomorrow
will be yesterday... ♪

00:17:40.204 --> 00:17:41.973
‐ I didn't have
many friends growing up.

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:44.575
I'd always picture myself
towering over the other kids

00:17:44.641 --> 00:17:47.244
and that made me
keep to myself.

00:17:47.311 --> 00:17:48.980
I started playing VR games

00:17:49.046 --> 00:17:52.083
as a sort of therapy
for my self‐consciousness.

00:17:53.184 --> 00:17:54.485
The thinking was,

00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:56.520
if I could be
someone totally different,

00:17:56.587 --> 00:17:58.522
maybe that would help me
be more sociable.

00:17:58.589 --> 00:18:02.826
After some trial and error,
I finally found a game I liked,

00:18:02.893 --> 00:18:06.030
one that let me play
as a short, cute character,

00:18:06.097 --> 00:18:10.534
one dressed all in pink,
so super cute.

00:18:10.601 --> 00:18:12.136
In case you were wondering,

00:18:12.203 --> 00:18:14.605
the game is called
"Gun Gale Online."

00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:16.273
It takes place
on a ravaged Earth

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.310
where players shoot each other
with all kinds of guns.

00:18:19.376 --> 00:18:22.413
It's pretty brutal, but because
of the character I get to be

00:18:22.479 --> 00:18:25.917
and listening to your music
while playing, I don't mind.

00:18:25.983 --> 00:18:27.718
Hopefully my experiences
in the game

00:18:27.784 --> 00:18:30.654
will give me the courage
I lack in real life.

00:18:33.524 --> 00:18:35.092
I'm sorry
for the rambling letter,

00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:36.627
but if you're
still reading this,

00:18:36.693 --> 00:18:39.496
I'd like to ask you
for a favor.

00:18:39.563 --> 00:18:41.232
If it's possible,
could you please

00:18:41.298 --> 00:18:43.600
hold your next concert
in a larger venue?

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:45.802
I'm sure there were
lots of folks like me

00:18:45.869 --> 00:18:48.205
who couldn't get
a ticket for your last one.

00:18:49.706 --> 00:18:51.008
Thank you for reading this

00:18:51.075 --> 00:18:53.444
and for all
the wonderful songs.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.046

Announcer:
"Gun Gale Online" players,

00:19:01.885 --> 00:19:03.620
stand by for an announcement!

00:19:03.687 --> 00:19:08.125
We're hosting
a battle royale at 1400.

00:19:08.192 --> 00:19:09.994
Get ready for Squad Jam!

00:19:10.061 --> 00:19:13.464
‐ You don't know how excited
I am to be sponsoring this.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.132
I hope everyone has a blast,

00:19:15.199 --> 00:19:17.001
both literally
and figuratively.

00:19:17.068 --> 00:19:19.170
‐ Try your luck,
and guess how many shots

00:19:19.236 --> 00:19:20.905
will be fired
during the tournament!

00:19:20.972 --> 00:19:22.773
‐ Ready, M? 'Cause I sure am!

00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:24.341
‐ Oh, almost forgot.

00:19:24.408 --> 00:19:26.110
‐ Pito gave me a message.
‐ What?

00:19:26.177 --> 00:19:29.080
She said we'd better
win today, or else.

00:19:29.146 --> 00:19:32.783
‐ Yeah, that sounds
like her all right.

00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:37.221
‐ I told her I'd do the best
I could, both of us would.

00:19:38.722 --> 00:19:42.426
I also told her if you
get killed, I might resign.

00:19:42.493 --> 00:19:44.595
Hope you don't mind.

00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:46.863
‐ No, that's fine.

00:19:46.931 --> 00:19:51.068
‐ Then let's see how far
we get today and have some fun.

00:19:51.135 --> 00:19:52.769
‐ Roger that!

00:19:52.836 --> 00:19:54.438
Announcer: Okay, Squad Jammers,

00:19:54.505 --> 00:19:56.007
it's almost time to start,

00:19:56.073 --> 00:20:00.444
but first are all teams present
and ready to teleport?

00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:02.613
Players: Yeah!

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:04.281
M: All right. Gear up.

00:20:04.348 --> 00:20:05.682
‐ Right.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:07.985
‐ Don't forget to pack

00:20:08.052 --> 00:20:09.553
your Satellite Scan Terminal.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.655
‐ Mm‐hmm.

00:20:11.722 --> 00:20:13.925
‐ And pack this, too.

00:20:13.991 --> 00:20:15.192
‐ [gasps]

00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:20.864
[gasps] Really?

00:20:20.932 --> 00:20:23.034
Like, you think I'll need it?

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.702
‐ It's good to have
in case you run out of ammo.

00:20:25.769 --> 00:20:28.472
‐ But I'm bringing along
a ton of mags.

00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:30.874
‐ What if you
get caught in a room?

00:20:30.942 --> 00:20:33.877
Sometimes in close quarters,
a knife's better than a gun,

00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:37.681
especially for someone like you
with a high level of agility.

00:20:37.748 --> 00:20:40.451
Strap it to your lower back,
horizontal.

00:20:40.517 --> 00:20:44.721
When you use it, draw it
with your right, backhanded.

00:20:44.788 --> 00:20:46.890
Your enemy
will be bigger than you,

00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:49.026
but you can dash
between their legs

00:20:49.093 --> 00:20:50.928
and slash at their inner thigh.

00:20:50.995 --> 00:20:52.696
That's where
the femoral artery is,

00:20:52.763 --> 00:20:54.932
and if you hit it,
you'll do a lot of damage.

00:20:54.999 --> 00:20:57.168
If the enemy's
drawing down on you,

00:20:57.234 --> 00:21:00.437
dash forward, and aim for
the inner part of their bicep.

00:21:00.504 --> 00:21:03.040
Then slash upward, like this!

00:21:03.107 --> 00:21:04.475
And if you can get behind them,

00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:07.544
slash through their boot
into their Achilles tendon.

00:21:07.611 --> 00:21:08.812
Once your enemy's down,

00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:10.781
draw the blade
across their neck,

00:21:10.847 --> 00:21:12.483
and make a long cut.

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:14.051
‐ Where'd he learn all this?

00:21:14.118 --> 00:21:16.620
‐ Go for the eyes
when attacking the head.

00:21:16.687 --> 00:21:18.522
Make sure to stab
straight and hard,

00:21:18.589 --> 00:21:20.024
and you'll damage the brain.

00:21:20.091 --> 00:21:22.226
If you wanna score
an instant kill with a knife,

00:21:22.293 --> 00:21:24.328
you either go
for the enemy's throat

00:21:24.395 --> 00:21:25.629
or their eyes.

00:21:25.696 --> 00:21:28.132
‐ Roger that.

00:21:31.936 --> 00:21:33.770
‐ All right. Hope you're ready.

00:21:33.837 --> 00:21:34.972
‐ Yep, you know it!

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:36.640
‐ Glad you're fired up
about this.

00:21:36.707 --> 00:21:38.375
‐ To be honest,
if I got a ticket

00:21:38.442 --> 00:21:41.645
to Elza Kanzaki's concert first,
I wouldn't have signed up.

00:21:41.712 --> 00:21:43.948
‐ That sucks
you couldn't get a ticket.

00:21:44.015 --> 00:21:48.185
‐ It's okay. I'm glad I'm here.

00:21:48.252 --> 00:21:51.388
[thinking] Let's do our best
out there, P‐chan.

00:21:51.455 --> 00:21:52.489
[buzzer sounds]

00:21:52.556 --> 00:21:53.890
‐ Get ready, players!

00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:56.393
The Squad Jam's about to start!

00:21:58.395 --> 00:22:00.831
Karen: We called ourselves
Team LM

00:22:00.897 --> 00:22:02.366
because of our initials.

00:22:02.433 --> 00:22:06.003
In a few seconds,
we'd be going into battle.
