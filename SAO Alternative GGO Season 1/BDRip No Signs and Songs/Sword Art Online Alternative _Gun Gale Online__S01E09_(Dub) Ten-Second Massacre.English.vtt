WEBVTT

00:00:01.106 --> 00:00:03.674
Fuka: Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

00:00:03.741 --> 00:00:05.943
‐ Those teams near Pito,
that's what.

00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:07.445
They're working together now.

00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:09.614
‐ Huh? Why would they do that?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.816
‐ There's only one reason
I can think of.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.785
I bet someone called
for a cease‐fire.

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:17.088
Whoever it is must be
a good negotiator,

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:20.125
'cause they convinced
all those teams to join forces.

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.494
Now they're in command
of an army of dozens of people,

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:24.829
and I bet you anything

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:27.698
they're on their way
to attack M and Pito.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:31.269
Pito, you better not die yet.

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:33.771
I'm supposed to kill you.

00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:37.475
‐ [crowd murmuring]
‐ This is no good.

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:39.277
‐ Twenty‐nine against six.

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:42.347
‐ I know. But, hey, at least
this battle won't be boring.

00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:43.648
‐ I bet the princess

00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:45.983
is crapping her black cat‐suit
right about now.

00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:49.154
‐ True that. That chick's
a liability if I ever saw one.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.122
‐ Women! Every time
there's a fight,

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:53.824
you can count on them going,
"Eee! Get me out of here!

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:58.063
This is too scary!" They can
be such a drag, am I right?

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:01.999
[Pito laughs]

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:06.171
They're so clever. [laughs]

00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:10.441
Some genius got seven teams
together to gang up on us.

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:12.543
This is the best thing ever.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.379
Man: There's a hell
of a lot more of them

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:17.448
than there are of us.
The odds ain't in our favor.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:18.783
What are we gonna do?

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:20.918
‐ Simple. We're gonna
set up an ambush

00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:22.820
and wipe out
every last one of 'em.

00:01:22.887 --> 00:01:24.489
‐ You're kidding.

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:26.991
‐ Nope. Talk to M.

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:30.261
He'll explain exactly
how to set this massacre up.

00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:04.090
‐ They're in range,
150 to 200 hundred meters.

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:07.560
‐ It's go time.
All teams, converge.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.565
‐ Are they sure this is it?

00:03:12.632 --> 00:03:14.634
‐ B Team, you guys see anything?

00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:16.936
‐ No. No movement.

00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:18.471
‐ They might have bailed.

00:03:18.538 --> 00:03:20.072
‐ Wait. See that?

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.745
‐ [scoffs] They think
they're safe in there.

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:27.580
‐ All teams,
we have reason to believe

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:29.116
target's behind the falls.

00:03:29.182 --> 00:03:32.385
Make things hot in there
for 'em. Fire at will!

00:03:32.452 --> 00:03:34.020
‐ Fire!

00:03:44.897 --> 00:03:46.166
[Pito laughs]

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:49.035
Now that is what I call
a hail of bullets.

00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:51.204
So how you doing in there?

00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:52.605
‐ I got shot.

00:03:52.672 --> 00:03:53.806
Pito: Are you gonna die?!

00:03:53.873 --> 00:03:56.276
‐ I'm sorry to say this, but no.

00:03:56.343 --> 00:03:59.512
Pito: Darn it! And I was
all set to go avenge you.

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.416
‐ Thanks. Anyway, the others
are in place and standing by.

00:04:03.483 --> 00:04:05.518
When I give the sign,
do what you do.

00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:07.120
Pito: You don't
have to tell me twice.

00:04:07.187 --> 00:04:09.156
Let's get this show
on the road.

00:04:09.222 --> 00:04:10.490
‐ Uh‐huh.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.433
‐ [screaming]

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.770
‐ They're alive!
Open fire! Go! Go!

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.980
Pito: I'm moving in.
I won't be needing backup.

00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:35.182
‐ Roger that.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.891
‐ Holy crap!
‐ [chuckles]

00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:49.462
‐ [crack]
‐ [laughs]

00:04:54.234 --> 00:04:56.503
‐ What'd she do that for?

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:57.837
‐ Hi!

00:04:57.904 --> 00:04:59.539
‐ [groans] Ow.

00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:00.673
[groans]

00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:03.576
‐ Huh?
‐ [both scream]

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:08.348
[Pito laughs]

00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:16.256
‐ Jesus! She killed 'em all.

00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:19.626
What in the goddamn hell is she?

00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:24.664
Man: Thought your shield
was bulletproof.

00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:27.200
‐ Couple slugs bounced
off the rocks and hit me.

00:05:27.267 --> 00:05:29.236
Long as it's not my head,
I'm good.

00:05:29.302 --> 00:05:32.805
Man: I told you this was gonna
be dangerous. No one listens.

00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:33.806
‐ Where's Pito?

00:05:33.873 --> 00:05:35.074
Man #2: She's down there

00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:37.577
fartin' around
with the last two guys.

00:05:37.644 --> 00:05:38.945
‐ [grumbles]

00:05:43.316 --> 00:05:44.851
‐ Get it over with already.

00:05:44.917 --> 00:05:46.052
‐ I'd like to.

00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:50.623
He still has his gun, though,

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.161
so I'm just standing here,
waiting for him to draw it.

00:05:54.227 --> 00:05:56.896
It's not right to shoot
a defenseless person.

00:05:56.963 --> 00:05:58.698
I couldn't live with myself
if I did.

00:05:58.765 --> 00:06:02.569
‐ But you don't have a problem
watching that poor guy suffer.

00:06:02.635 --> 00:06:05.505
We don't have time for this.
Do him already.

00:06:05.572 --> 00:06:07.574
‐ Fine, whatever. There.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.710
‐ Gah! [grunting]

00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:13.980
‐ Uh‐oh. He's still holding on.

00:06:14.046 --> 00:06:15.315
‐ [grunts]

00:06:15.382 --> 00:06:17.584
‐ Oh, my God,
would you let go already?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.787
‐ Is this fun for you,
torturing another player?

00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:22.255
Psycho!

00:06:22.322 --> 00:06:27.627
‐ Is it fun being on a team
of thirty ganging up on six?

00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:31.030
Hell, yes! It's hard
to pick which is more fun,

00:06:31.097 --> 00:06:32.932
and I know
that if we switched places,

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:34.267
you'd do the same to me, buddy.

00:06:34.334 --> 00:06:37.337
‐ Let go! This is
the one chance you got, man!

00:06:37.404 --> 00:06:38.938
Drop me, and kill that bitch!

00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:41.774
‐ No way.
Until these guys are dead,

00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:43.143
we're in this thing together.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.212
Besides, our leaders
are listening in,

00:06:45.278 --> 00:06:47.414
and I bet they're
on their way to save us.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.081
‐ Let me go.

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:51.451
‐ Right. Back to it.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.587
Why won't you die?

00:06:54.654 --> 00:06:57.190
[sighs] This is why
I hate using pistols.

00:06:57.257 --> 00:06:59.359
And now I'm out of ammo. Hmph.

00:06:59.426 --> 00:07:01.561
‐ You had a solid strategy.

00:07:01.628 --> 00:07:04.697
You fought well,
but you have to face reality.

00:07:04.764 --> 00:07:06.032
Even if your leaders come,

00:07:06.098 --> 00:07:07.934
they don't stand
a chance against us.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.169
‐ [growls]

00:07:09.236 --> 00:07:10.503
M: Tell 'em this.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.405
Resign now, or else.

00:07:12.472 --> 00:07:14.707
‐ No, you idiot!
Where's the fun in that?!

00:07:14.774 --> 00:07:17.544
New idea.
Tell your leaders this instead.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.213
"We totally got our asses
kicked by those guys.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.081
They were so tough,
but you're tougher,

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:24.751
so please come on up,
and avenge us." Hee hee.

00:07:24.817 --> 00:07:26.319
‐ Can you do that?
‐ Uh‐huh.

00:07:26.386 --> 00:07:28.955
And when they find you,
they're gonna butcher you all.

00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:30.323
‐ You're all gonna pay for this!

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.791
‐ Look at your faces.

00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:35.094
That's the kind of hate
I've been waiting for.

00:07:35.162 --> 00:07:36.095
Later, boys.

00:07:36.163 --> 00:07:37.997
[both stammer]

00:07:38.064 --> 00:07:39.499
‐ You're all bastards!

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:41.067
‐ Rot in hell!

00:07:43.536 --> 00:07:45.972
[Pito chuckles]
Seemed like those two

00:07:46.038 --> 00:07:48.074
got to be good friends
at the end there.

00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:52.112
In ten minutes, they'll be
buying drinks for each other.

00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:53.713
How cool is that?

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.950
‐ God damn it! What the hell
happened up there?!

00:07:58.017 --> 00:07:59.819
‐ Every last one of 'em's dead.

00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:01.954
‐ I'll make 'em pay
for what they did to‐‐

00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:03.256
‐ [screams]
‐ [leaders gasp]

00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:17.970
Pito: One more to go, and‐‐

00:08:18.037 --> 00:08:20.573
No. Wait. [groans]

00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:25.445
Bummer.
I really wanted to kill him.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.982
‐ Damn, dude.
How many did she kill?

00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:32.652
‐ I stopped counting
when she got to 20.

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:36.055
‐ She went full‐on berserk.
She even used her hands, man.

00:08:36.123 --> 00:08:41.027
‐ I know that gun.
It's an M107A1. There's, like,

00:08:41.093 --> 00:08:43.930
only supposed to be one
of those on the Japanese server.

00:08:43.996 --> 00:08:47.934
‐ Anti‐materiel rifles like that
are popping up more and more.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.738
In the last B.o.B., this girl
named Sinon had a Hecate Two,

00:08:51.804 --> 00:08:53.340
and she kicked all the ass.

00:08:53.406 --> 00:08:56.176
‐ Picking those dudes off
was easy with that rifle,

00:08:56.243 --> 00:08:57.510
even at her distance.

00:08:57.577 --> 00:08:59.679
Man: I wonder what other
surprises she's got.

00:08:59.746 --> 00:09:01.448
‐ Now we know
one thing for sure.

00:09:01.514 --> 00:09:03.883
That team's gonna
destroy everyone and win.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.086
M's got that shield,
and those tactical‐looking mofos

00:09:07.154 --> 00:09:08.621
are nothing
to sneeze at, either,

00:09:08.688 --> 00:09:11.424
but with that woman, too,
they're unstoppable.

00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:13.660
The other teams are dead.
They just don't know it ye‐‐

00:09:13.726 --> 00:09:16.263
‐ Who cares about them?!
check out how LLENN's doing!

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:17.530
Don't count her out just yet.

00:09:17.597 --> 00:09:19.132
As long as she's alive,

00:09:19.199 --> 00:09:21.501
there's still
a chance she can win.

00:09:25.374 --> 00:09:28.143
LLENN: Okay, Fuka,
I'm at 100 meters.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.444
No enemies in sight.

00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:31.313
‐ [radio] Roger that.
Light the way,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.747
and I'll catch up to you.

00:09:34.316 --> 00:09:35.617
‐ Here you go.

00:09:36.985 --> 00:09:38.487
‐ There's your Bullet Line.

00:09:38.553 --> 00:09:40.722
Heading over to you now.

00:09:42.157 --> 00:09:44.226
[spits] Whose idea was it

00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:46.728
to stick a grassy field
in this dome?

00:09:53.202 --> 00:09:54.236
[groans]

00:09:54.303 --> 00:09:55.970
I'm like a Hokkaido cockroach

00:09:56.037 --> 00:09:58.207
scuttling across
the kitchen floor,

00:09:58.273 --> 00:10:00.175
if Hokkaido had roaches.

00:10:00.242 --> 00:10:03.011
Well, Mom?
Are we there yet, or what?

00:10:03.077 --> 00:10:04.613
‐ We're about halfway now.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:07.416
‐ [groans]
That's as far as we got?

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.951
‐ Sorry. We're going
as fast as we can

00:10:10.018 --> 00:10:11.320
using the Bullet Line trick.

00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:13.522
Besides, it's safer in here.

00:10:13.588 --> 00:10:16.125
If we'd gone
around the north side,

00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:18.160
we would have bumped into MMTM,

00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:20.028
and South,
it would have been SHINC.

00:10:20.094 --> 00:10:23.732
Going through the dome is
the fastest way to get to Pito

00:10:23.798 --> 00:10:24.899
and the safest.

00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:28.370
‐ So what about the three teams
in here with us?

00:10:28.437 --> 00:10:31.273
‐ Yeah, them. I guess
this is where we find out

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.342
how lucky I am or not.

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:35.244
Are you sure your wings

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.078
didn't transfer over
from the other game?

00:10:37.146 --> 00:10:40.382
I could hang underneath you
and shoot while you fly.

00:10:40.449 --> 00:10:42.417
‐ Nope, sorry.

00:10:42.484 --> 00:10:45.920
I gave up all my fairy skills
to come help you out here.

00:10:45.987 --> 00:10:47.489
[automatic gunfire]

00:10:49.258 --> 00:10:50.992
‐ Hmm.

00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:52.994
That's ahead and to the left,

00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:55.430
mm, about 200 meters from us.

00:10:55.497 --> 00:10:57.399
I don't see Bullet Lines,
though.

00:10:57.466 --> 00:10:59.368
‐ Then they're fighting
each other.

00:10:59.434 --> 00:11:01.336
That could
totally work out for us.

00:11:01.403 --> 00:11:04.439
Keep up the good work, guys.
Wipe each other out.

00:11:05.807 --> 00:11:08.810
‐ No. It's weird, real weird.

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:11.646
Something's not right
about the way they're shooting.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:12.947
‐ Like what?

00:11:13.014 --> 00:11:15.617
‐ Like this is a trap.

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:17.319
You see those three teams?

00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:19.488
I bet you anything
they're working together,

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.790
just like the ones
going after Pito.

00:11:21.856 --> 00:11:24.226
They must have seen us
on the last scan

00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:25.894
and figured we'd
cut through the dome.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.564
‐ Ooh, you're so popular!
This is getting exciting.

00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:32.534
So how do you know
it's a trap?

00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:35.270
‐ You saw where the three
team leaders were on the map,

00:11:35.337 --> 00:11:37.071
so it's kinda weird
all that gunfire

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:39.174
is coming from the same
direction and distance.

00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:43.245
The only explanation
is they're all shooting
from the same position.

00:11:43.312 --> 00:11:46.014
‐ Wow, you sure have sharp ears.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.749
So what do you wanna do?

00:11:47.816 --> 00:11:50.485
Sneak up from behind and
blast 'em back to the saloon?

00:11:50.552 --> 00:11:53.455
‐ No. I don't want to waste
my ammo on these guys.

00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:55.524
If we keep moving
and be careful,

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.791
we can avoid them.

00:11:56.858 --> 00:11:59.728
‐ Roger‐dodger.
Lead the way, girl.

00:11:59.794 --> 00:12:02.096
‐ I'm gonna take
a little detour to the right.

00:12:02.164 --> 00:12:03.632
Could you please give me a Line?

00:12:03.698 --> 00:12:06.968
‐ Okay! I'll aim
another 100 meters ahead.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.938

‐ Yeah, but they know
where I'm at!

00:12:26.388 --> 00:12:28.323
Your shot saved me,
but I used a whole mag

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.624
taking four of 'em down.

00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:31.893
I only have 700 bullets left.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.827
‐ Uh, how can I help?

00:12:32.894 --> 00:12:34.696
‐ Come to me.
‐ Coming!

00:12:36.331 --> 00:12:37.266
Eh?

They're shooting at me!
They're shooting at me!

‐ I can't! I can't!

00:12:43.238 --> 00:12:45.340
If I get up to run,
they'll blow my head off!

Get out while you can. Survive.

00:12:57.051 --> 00:13:00.088

we were saving.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.356
‐ Okay! I'm ready!

I can barely see
what I'm shooting at.

in the smoke with us!

know where they are?

if we could chat for a bit.

00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:50.681
‐ Whoa now! Wait a second!

00:17:50.747 --> 00:17:52.916
That's all the ammo
I have in the game.

00:17:52.983 --> 00:17:55.085
Why do you wanna bone
a fellow player like that?

00:17:55.152 --> 00:17:58.054
‐ I'm gonna win this! And I
need your mags to, so gimme!

00:17:58.122 --> 00:18:00.991
‐ Ha! Looks like
I got you over a barrel!

00:18:01.057 --> 00:18:02.193
[laughing]

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:04.928
‐ Fuka, I'm gonna blow off
his arms and legs.

00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:07.764
Could you please go behind
and loot his storage?

00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:08.932
‐ Okey‐dokey!

00:18:08.999 --> 00:18:10.301
‐ You guys might be cute,

00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:12.769
but you're as ruthless
as a bunch of pirates.

00:18:12.836 --> 00:18:15.839
Uh, news flash.
This is being broadcast.

00:18:15.906 --> 00:18:17.808
They can't hear
what we're saying,

00:18:17.874 --> 00:18:19.810
but it's obvious
what you're doing.

00:18:19.876 --> 00:18:22.346
Robbing a defenseless player's
pretty low.

00:18:22.413 --> 00:18:24.148
It's even worse,
'cause you're ladies.

00:18:24.215 --> 00:18:26.917
This moment'll go down
in G.G.O. history.

00:18:26.983 --> 00:18:29.286
‐ You gonna give me
all your mags, or what?

00:18:29.353 --> 00:18:32.656
‐ [sighs] Okay, okay,
I'll give 'em to you.

00:18:32.723 --> 00:18:35.058
I'll just have to grind away
'til the end of time

00:18:35.126 --> 00:18:36.560
to get 'em back, but whatever.

00:18:36.627 --> 00:18:38.262
[sighs]

00:18:38.329 --> 00:18:39.763
[chuckles]

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.599
Before I do, maybe you
could give me something

00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:44.435
as thanks for my generosity?

00:18:44.501 --> 00:18:45.736
LLENN: Like what.

00:18:45.802 --> 00:18:49.306
‐ Oh, I was thinking
about something small,

00:18:49.373 --> 00:18:50.441
something like a kiss?

00:18:50.507 --> 00:18:51.875
‐ Say what?!
‐ Huh?!

00:18:51.942 --> 00:18:54.278
‐ It's just a kiss, a smooch,

00:18:54.345 --> 00:18:55.812
a little peck.

00:18:55.879 --> 00:18:57.981
I'd love it if I got one
from both of you,

00:18:58.048 --> 00:18:59.916
but I'll settle for you, Pinky.

00:18:59.983 --> 00:19:02.386
One teeny kiss,
and my mags are yours.

00:19:02.453 --> 00:19:05.256
Right here.
One little kiss on the cheek.

00:19:05.322 --> 00:19:07.023
‐ [groans]

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.194
‐ Oh, my God. This game
is chock‐full of lechers.

00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:12.163
LLENN, who cares
about the mags?

00:19:12.229 --> 00:19:14.265
I'm gonna blow
his skeezy head off.

00:19:14.331 --> 00:19:15.266
‐ I'll do it.

00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:16.500
‐ Uh...

00:19:16.567 --> 00:19:18.369
‐ It's not a big deal.

00:19:18.435 --> 00:19:19.870
‐ For real?

00:19:19.936 --> 00:19:21.338
Are you crazy?!

00:19:21.405 --> 00:19:24.007
‐ This kid's got some issues,
for sure,

00:19:24.074 --> 00:19:27.178
but if all I have to do is
kiss him to get at those mags,

00:19:27.244 --> 00:19:28.912
it's way better
than robbing him.

00:19:28.979 --> 00:19:31.047
‐ Yes! [laughs] I get a kiss!

00:19:31.115 --> 00:19:32.483
‐ I get a kiss!
‐ Well, as long as...

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:34.318
‐ I get a kiss!
‐ you're cool with it, have fun.

00:19:34.385 --> 00:19:36.720
‐ I said I'd do it,
but I want the mags first!

00:19:36.787 --> 00:19:37.921
‐ You got it.

00:19:37.988 --> 00:19:40.957
Just do like you promised,
you cutie.

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:47.864
‐ Cha‐ching!
You just hit the jackpot.

00:19:47.931 --> 00:19:49.366
Now let me kill this goon.

00:19:49.433 --> 00:19:50.501
‐ Stop it.

00:19:52.068 --> 00:19:54.070
‐ You look so scary.

00:19:54.138 --> 00:19:56.740
‐ I hate giving you
the satisfaction,

00:19:56.807 --> 00:19:59.110
but I did promise you.

00:20:01.512 --> 00:20:05.182
[stammering]

00:20:05.249 --> 00:20:06.283
[kiss]

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.618
‐ Oh! Clever!

00:20:07.684 --> 00:20:09.120
Even if this is live,

00:20:09.186 --> 00:20:11.488
folks'll think you're
just whispering in his ear.

00:20:11.555 --> 00:20:13.124
‐ All right. Are you happy now?

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.825
‐ You don't even know.

00:20:14.891 --> 00:20:16.860
[laughs] My heart's pounding!

00:20:16.927 --> 00:20:18.495
[laughs] Love it.

00:20:18.562 --> 00:20:22.199
Nothing in the world
compares to how a girl kisses.

00:20:22.266 --> 00:20:25.068
It's not all rough and crude
like how guys always kiss.

00:20:25.136 --> 00:20:27.037
‐ Uh, I'm sorry. What?

00:20:27.104 --> 00:20:28.639
‐ He said he kissed guys.

00:20:28.705 --> 00:20:32.075
Do you, like, force them
to kiss you like you do girls?

00:20:32.143 --> 00:20:34.878
‐ No! Not even.
Might as well tell you.

00:20:34.945 --> 00:20:36.780
You see, I'm a girl IRL.

00:20:36.847 --> 00:20:38.182
Both: You are?!

00:20:38.249 --> 00:20:39.616
‐ My avatar's female, too,

00:20:39.683 --> 00:20:42.719
but it's androgynous,
so I have a guyish voice.

00:20:42.786 --> 00:20:43.954
I wish she were chestier.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.823
Wait. It's easier
just to show you.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.959
See? Female.

00:20:49.025 --> 00:20:50.761
And in real life, I'm bi.

00:20:50.827 --> 00:20:52.729
‐ Hold it. We're in a game.

00:20:52.796 --> 00:20:54.097
Don't talk about real life here.

00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:56.533
‐ It's cool.
I don't care if you know.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.902
And now that you do,
let's have drinks sometime,

00:20:58.969 --> 00:21:00.471
just us virtual girls.

00:21:00.537 --> 00:21:03.073
Come on. There's hardly
any girls in G.G.O.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.575
Let's be friends.
It'll be great.

00:21:04.641 --> 00:21:08.345
But, like, you have no idea
who we are in real life.

00:21:08.412 --> 00:21:10.681
I‐I could be
a 50‐year‐old woman!

00:21:10.747 --> 00:21:12.015
‐ Who cares if you are?

00:21:12.082 --> 00:21:14.218
I don't. I love everybody.

00:21:14.285 --> 00:21:15.919
Look, since we
know each other now,

00:21:15.986 --> 00:21:18.489
we should form
an all‐girl squad. Come on!

00:21:18.555 --> 00:21:22.058
‐ Would you just resign already
and let us get back to the game?

00:21:22.126 --> 00:21:25.562
‐ Well, um, thanks again
for handing over your mags.

00:21:25.629 --> 00:21:27.631
‐ My pleasure.

00:21:27.698 --> 00:21:29.600
[beeping]

00:21:29.666 --> 00:21:30.667
‐ What the‐‐

00:21:30.734 --> 00:21:31.935
‐ Get down!

00:21:32.869 --> 00:21:34.037
‐ LLENN!

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.443
‐ Go on. Win this thing!

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.711
‐ [gasps]

00:21:40.777 --> 00:21:43.680
‐ [groans]

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.951
[both yelp]

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.688
Crap!

00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:53.624
All that talking distracted us.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.627
It gave another team
the chance to move in.

00:21:56.693 --> 00:21:57.628
Wonder who.

00:22:03.967 --> 00:22:06.270
It's MMTM.
