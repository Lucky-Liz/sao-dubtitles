00:00:01.973 --> 00:00:03.509
Narrator: If you
died in a game,

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:05.944
you didn't die in real life.

00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:08.313
That was before
"Sword Art Online."

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.482
The incident claimed
many lives, and, as a result,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.553
almost ended the development
of all VR games.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.822
But when the admin package
called "the Seed"

00:00:16.888 --> 00:00:20.158
became available, guaranteeing
the player's safety,

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:24.162
development not only continued,
it skyrocketed.

00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:26.397
One such game became popular,

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:28.499
thanks to its
post‐apocalyptic environments

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:31.102
and player‐versus‐player duels,

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.739
where guns are used
instead of swords

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:35.306
and the roar of gunfire

00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:38.877
blows across the terrain
like a hellish wind.

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:40.679
It's appropriately called...

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:43.114
Announcer:
"Gun Gale Online" players,

00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:45.684
please stand by
for an announcement!

00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:52.357
Today, at 1400 hours,
we're hosting Squad Jam,

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:55.093
a battle royale tournament
for teams!

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.663
[players cheering]

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.398
Announcer: Each team
can have a max of six players,

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:02.701
and there are 23 teams
gunning for first place,

00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:05.303
so pick your fave,
and cheer them on to victory!

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.206
‐ It's good to see
you're fired up about this.

00:01:08.273 --> 00:01:09.975
‐ To be honest,
if I got a ticket

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:13.478
to Elza Kanzaki's concert first,
I wouldn't have signed up.

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:15.380
‐ That sucks
you couldn't get a ticket.

00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:19.384
‐ It's okay. I'm glad I'm here.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.788
[thinking] Let's do our best
out there, P‐chan.

00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:26.658
Announcer: Get ready!
The Squad Jam's about to start!

00:01:26.725 --> 00:01:29.127
[players cheer]

00:02:59.486 --> 00:03:02.756
Announcer: Squad Jam is on!

00:03:02.823 --> 00:03:04.157
[buzzer sounds]

00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:06.359
[whooshing]

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.765
[girl sighs]

00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:16.336
Whoa. They're starting us
in a big forest.

00:03:16.403 --> 00:03:18.271
‐ This isn't good.

00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:20.508
‐ Why? Because the trees
block your shots

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:21.942
and my outfit stands out?

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.012
‐ Yup. Wear this
'til we get out of here.

00:03:25.078 --> 00:03:26.346
‐ Uh...

00:03:26.413 --> 00:03:28.549
‐ You can shoot through
the poncho if you want.

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:30.150
‐ I'll get another one.
‐ [device beeps]

00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:32.653
Time to get oriented.

00:03:35.288 --> 00:03:37.257
‐ Looks like
we're the only ones here.

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:39.359
‐ No enemies
within a klick of us.

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:41.228
We'll skip going north and east.

00:03:41.294 --> 00:03:43.864
‐ So where to?

00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:45.232
Have a preference?

00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:47.200
‐ We should head due south.

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:48.969
That's the urban area.

00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:52.372
Try to stay
ten meters behind me.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.941
‐ Roger that. Lead the way.

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.918
‐ [on radio] Stop. Get down.
‐ [automatic gunfire]

00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:07.588
That's the sound
of a 556 assault rifle.

00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:11.191
And that's the sound
of a submachine gun.

00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:12.760
‐ You can tell?
‐ Yeah.

00:04:12.826 --> 00:04:15.395
Two teams are
after the same position.

00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:17.397
They probably
surprised each other.

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:20.100
They're in the forest
to the west of us.

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:21.234
‐ They sound so close.

00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:22.870
‐ I got an idea.

00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:25.072
LLENN, you take point.

00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:26.807
Head in that direction.

00:04:26.874 --> 00:04:28.776
I'll let you know
if you go off course.

00:04:28.842 --> 00:04:31.044
‐ Sure. Roger that.

00:04:33.113 --> 00:04:36.517
[groans] Please don't let me
run into any enemies.

00:04:40.521 --> 00:04:42.890
Hey, M,
I can't hear any shooting.

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:44.858
Do you think they
might be headed this way?

00:04:44.925 --> 00:04:46.860
‐ Don't stand there
wondering about it.

00:04:46.927 --> 00:04:48.529
‐ [groans]
‐ Move.

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:50.998
‐ The enemy could be anywhere,

00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:52.199
behind a tree,

00:04:52.265 --> 00:04:54.735
waiting to snipe at me.

00:04:54.802 --> 00:04:55.736
[yelps]

00:04:55.803 --> 00:04:57.738
[groaning]

00:04:59.472 --> 00:05:00.641
That does it!

00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:02.576
What the heck am I afraid of?!

00:05:02.643 --> 00:05:05.412
Even if they kill me,
P‐chan'll tear 'em up first.

00:05:14.722 --> 00:05:16.289
[gasps]

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:17.891
M: Stop!

00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:18.959
Down.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.294
Stay alert.

00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:22.763
Eyes front!

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.764
‐ [gasps]

00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:26.099
‐ I'm 300 meters behind you.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.968
It's the nine‐minute mark.

00:05:28.035 --> 00:05:29.269
When the SAT‐scan finishes,

00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:31.505
the enemy will only see
your position.

00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:33.240
That's why I'm hanging back.

00:05:33.306 --> 00:05:36.744
‐ Got it. Only the team leader's
position is revealed.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.478
‐ Hmm. You're catching on.

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.113
If we're lucky
and the enemy's close,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.482
they'll attack you
when the scan's done.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.384
‐ But then what do I do?

00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:45.819
‐ Start spraying bullets,

00:05:45.886 --> 00:05:48.455
fall back, and use
the trees for cover.

00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:49.790
I'll circle around to the left

00:05:49.857 --> 00:05:51.692
and pick off
whoever's chasing you.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.428
‐ [thinking] Great.
I'm a decoy now? Awesome.

00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:57.264
‐ Don't bother
watching the scan.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.498
Just stay alert.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.167
‐ Roger that. [gasps]

00:06:00.233 --> 00:06:03.403
Uh, M, I spotted them.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.673
‐ Thirty seconds
'til the scan starts.

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:07.541
Tell me what you see,
and hurry.

00:06:07.608 --> 00:06:08.842
‐ [gasps] U‐Um...

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.978
they're on the other side
of the highway,

00:06:11.044 --> 00:06:12.379
i‐in the city.

00:06:12.445 --> 00:06:14.181
They're about 200 meters away.

00:06:14.247 --> 00:06:16.083
‐ Calm down.
How many are there?

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:17.150
What kind of guns?

00:06:17.217 --> 00:06:18.719
‐ I see five.

00:06:18.786 --> 00:06:20.588
I can't tell
what kind of guns they have,

00:06:20.654 --> 00:06:21.722
but they're not small.

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.357
They're behind a blown‐up wall.

00:06:24.424 --> 00:06:26.293
They're just standing around.

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:27.561
Wh‐What do I do?

00:06:27.628 --> 00:06:29.630
Should I open fire on 'em,
or what?

00:06:29.697 --> 00:06:31.832
‐ You can't hit them
with a P90 from there,

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:34.067
so relax. The scan's up.

00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:36.904
‐ [thinking] I can't believe
I have to sit here and wait.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.073
Should I wait,
or should I attack?

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.241
‐ Got 'em.

00:06:41.308 --> 00:06:42.910
There's one team on the border

00:06:42.976 --> 00:06:44.612
between the city
and the highway,

00:06:44.678 --> 00:06:46.479
about 200 meters from you.

00:06:46.547 --> 00:06:49.349
‐ Should I start falling back?
‐ Not yet.

00:06:49.416 --> 00:06:52.753
I doubt they'll attack you
right away from that distance.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.021
‐ [sighs]

00:06:55.856 --> 00:06:57.558
[gasps]

00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:00.093
[squeals]

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.830
[on radio]
M! They're targeting me!

00:07:05.032 --> 00:07:06.700
[screams]

00:07:08.902 --> 00:07:11.572
They got me pinned down
over here, M!

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.006
Help! Do something!

00:07:13.073 --> 00:07:14.842
‐ You know what
they're shooting?

00:07:14.908 --> 00:07:18.145
General‐purpose machine guns,
7.62 millimeter,

00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:21.281
probably MAGs, judging
by the sound of the rapid fire.

00:07:21.348 --> 00:07:23.450
There's more than two of them.

00:07:23.517 --> 00:07:25.452
If you listen,
you can just make out

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:28.021
the hum of another gun
firing even faster.

00:07:28.088 --> 00:07:29.456
Sounds like a 556.

00:07:31.458 --> 00:07:32.626
That's a Minimi.

00:07:32.693 --> 00:07:34.261
‐ Could you skip the lesson
and help me?!

00:07:34.327 --> 00:07:36.463
‐ As long as you're
behind that tree, you're safe,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.464
so stay put.

00:07:37.531 --> 00:07:39.600
‐ Oh, my gosh!

00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:42.002
[panting]

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:43.003
Damn it!

00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:47.909
[automatic gunfire]

00:07:47.976 --> 00:07:49.844
‐ It shouldn't
be much longer now.

00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:52.447
LLENN: What shouldn't?
What are you talking about?!

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.317
‐ Nothing.
Just stay where you are.

00:07:58.153 --> 00:08:02.224
‐ We're a rapid‐fire nightmare,
yo! Boo‐yah!

00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:04.793
‐ We won't stop firing
'til we run out of bullets!

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:09.364
‐ The Japan Machine Gun Lovers
are here to get it on!

00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:11.366
Whoo‐hoo!

00:08:13.468 --> 00:08:15.337
‐ Uh...

00:08:15.404 --> 00:08:17.539
‐ Yo, we got bogies on ou‐‐

00:08:20.275 --> 00:08:21.243
‐ It's a sniper!

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.112
[gasps] They're behind‐‐

00:08:23.678 --> 00:08:24.846
‐ Take cover!

00:08:24.913 --> 00:08:26.581
‐ Oh, crap!

00:08:29.251 --> 00:08:31.086
‐ [gasps] The shooting stopped.

00:08:31.153 --> 00:08:32.987
M: Another team
snuck up behind them

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:34.623
and started picking them off.

00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:36.225
Perfect timing.

00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.860
I'm heading over to you now,
so don't shoot me.

00:08:38.927 --> 00:08:42.064
‐ [sighs] That was too close.

00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:45.200
I almost died
without firing a single shot.

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:47.402
[bush rustling]

00:08:47.469 --> 00:08:48.403
Hey, M.

00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:50.905
‐ You can borrow my scope.

00:08:50.972 --> 00:08:54.743
I didn't tell you before, but I
saw that other team on the scan.

00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:57.812
They were close enough that I
figured they'd move on 'em.

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:00.649
‐ How come the machine gunners
didn't notice them?

00:09:00.715 --> 00:09:02.784
‐ Don't know. Maybe when
they checked the scan,

00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:04.853
they didn't realize
they were as close as they were.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:08.890
Or maybe they saw how close you
were and didn't check their six.

00:09:08.957 --> 00:09:10.692
Either way,
those guys were sloppy.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:14.196
‐ Wait! This whole time,
you were using me as a decoy

00:09:14.263 --> 00:09:16.331
to get
the machine gunners killed?!

00:09:16.398 --> 00:09:17.166
‐ Yup.

00:09:17.232 --> 00:09:19.134
‐ Glad I could help out.

00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:21.736
‐ Let's watch the action
from here.

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:25.907
There were five machine gunners.

00:09:25.974 --> 00:09:27.876
Three are dead. That leaves two.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.912
‐ They're totally distracted
by the sniper team.

00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:32.447
Wanna take 'em out?

00:09:32.514 --> 00:09:33.682
‐ No way.

00:09:33.748 --> 00:09:36.418
We're gonna sit here
nice and quiet for now.

00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:37.352
‐ [groans]

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:38.987
‐ Movement to the left of them

00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:40.022
on the wide street.

00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:42.424
Behind that torn‐up bus.

00:09:43.758 --> 00:09:46.895
You see how they're advancing?
Nice and tactical.

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:47.996
‐ Just the four?

00:09:48.063 --> 00:09:49.664
‐ No, that's not the whole team.

00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:51.100
‐ How do you know?

00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:53.135
‐ Where are the others?
You see 'em?

00:09:53.202 --> 00:09:55.704
‐ No, but they're out there.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.606
Those four are taking
the shortest route

00:09:57.672 --> 00:09:59.708
to the machine gunners.
They're using cover and moving

00:09:59.774 --> 00:10:01.443
like they know
where they're going.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.746
That means there's probably
two snipers up in a building

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.415
telling them which way to go.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.418
They're the ones that took out
the machine gunners.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:12.321
Wherever they are,
they had nice, clean shots.

00:10:12.387 --> 00:10:13.788
‐ I don't see 'em.

00:10:13.855 --> 00:10:15.157
‐ That's the point.

00:10:15.224 --> 00:10:16.858
A sniper that reveals
their position

00:10:16.925 --> 00:10:20.562
by letting their barrel hang out
in the open's a dead sniper.

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:23.432
I gotta hand it to 'em,
splitting up a team of six

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:26.301
the way they're doing's
a heck of a strategy.

00:10:26.368 --> 00:10:27.602
Whoever they are,

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.904
they definitely know
what they're doing.

00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:31.873
Those two are goners for sure.

00:10:34.643 --> 00:10:35.677
‐ Huh?
‐ Eh?

00:10:35.744 --> 00:10:37.279
‐ Run!

00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:43.385
‐ [yelps]

00:10:49.124 --> 00:10:50.859
‐ They're out in the open now.

00:10:50.925 --> 00:10:52.261
You gonna shoot 'em, or what?

00:10:52.327 --> 00:10:53.628
‐ Hell, no.

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.530
I could take one of 'em out,

00:10:55.597 --> 00:10:58.433
but the others would scatter
by the time I reset.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.269
Better to let 'em go.

00:11:00.335 --> 00:11:01.936
Besides, they won't
bother with us.

00:11:02.004 --> 00:11:04.406
They probably think
we retreated into the forest.

00:11:04.473 --> 00:11:05.907
‐ They're on the move now!

00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:07.376
‐ Got snipers.
‐ Where?

00:11:07.442 --> 00:11:10.579
‐ The building with the arch,
coming down the side.

00:11:13.415 --> 00:11:15.550
‐ What the heck? No way.

00:11:15.617 --> 00:11:18.920
‐ They're rappelling. Way faster
than taking the stairs.

00:11:18.987 --> 00:11:21.756
I didn't know you could get
a skill like that here.

00:11:21.823 --> 00:11:22.757
I want it.

00:11:22.824 --> 00:11:25.094
‐ That's not
just the G.G.O. skill.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.429
Trust me. I have it.

00:11:27.496 --> 00:11:29.098
The version
you can get in‐game

00:11:29.164 --> 00:11:32.501
doesn't let you descend as fast
as those guys are doing it.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.403
‐ Then how?
‐ Like I said,

00:11:34.469 --> 00:11:36.505
they didn't pick up
moves like that in here.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.807
Those guys know
how to rappel for real,

00:11:38.873 --> 00:11:40.509
and they're good at it.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.212
‐ Who are they?
Mountain climbers, maybe?

00:11:43.278 --> 00:11:44.813
‐ Not the way they handle guns.

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:47.916
‐ If you know what they do
in the real world,

00:11:47.982 --> 00:11:52.354
why don't you just come
right out and tell me already?

00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:55.490
‐ It's a guess, but seeing
how they move as a unit,

00:11:55.557 --> 00:11:58.527
have tactical skills,
and rappel as fast as they do,

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:02.597
I have a feeling they all
have serious combat training.

00:12:02.664 --> 00:12:03.398
‐ For real?

00:12:03.465 --> 00:12:05.500
‐ Those guys are pros.

00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:08.170
Handling weapons
is part of their job.

00:12:08.237 --> 00:12:10.805
They might be cops or soldiers,

00:12:10.872 --> 00:12:14.243
maybe even special forces.
Take your pick.

00:12:14.309 --> 00:12:16.411
‐ [gasping]

00:12:17.114 --> 00:12:20.784
What?! Isn't that the same
as cheating, then?!

00:12:20.851 --> 00:12:23.120
They can't play if they're
professional soldiers!

00:12:23.187 --> 00:12:26.023
‐ Last time I checked the rules,
they didn't say they couldn't.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.358
‐ [groans]

00:12:27.424 --> 00:12:29.726
‐ G.G.O. is perfect
for folks like them.

00:12:29.793 --> 00:12:32.496
They can play it to train,
and now with Squad Jam,

00:12:32.563 --> 00:12:34.598
they can test their skills
against others.

00:12:34.665 --> 00:12:37.101
‐ So now what?
If we don't take them out,

00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:39.736
we can't get in the city,
and we're stuck.

00:12:39.803 --> 00:12:42.206
Can't we just charge in,
guns blazing?

00:12:42.273 --> 00:12:45.009
‐ Nope.
‐ Can't we at least try it?!

00:12:45.076 --> 00:12:46.877
Fine. Have it your way.

00:12:46.943 --> 00:12:49.513
Okay, now what do we do?

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.615
‐ You consider yourself lucky?

00:12:51.682 --> 00:12:52.783
‐ Excuse me?

00:12:52.849 --> 00:12:55.286
‐ Up to this point,
would you say your life's

00:12:55.352 --> 00:12:57.121
been blessed with good luck?

00:12:57.188 --> 00:12:59.956
‐ Hmm, never thought about it.

00:13:00.024 --> 00:13:02.026
You know, yeah!

00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:03.960
My life has been lucky.

00:13:04.028 --> 00:13:05.862
I'm a lucky girl.

00:13:05.929 --> 00:13:06.897
[thinking]
I think.

00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:09.433
‐ Good enough.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.502
We're gonna bet
on that luck of yours.

00:13:11.568 --> 00:13:14.071
We'll wait here
'til the next scan.

00:13:14.138 --> 00:13:16.273
If luck's on our side,
we'll make our move.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.474
‐ What are you thinking?

00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:19.510
‐ I'm betting
the machine gunners

00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:23.247
made so much noise it attracts
the other teams to the area.

00:13:23.314 --> 00:13:24.948
While the pro team's
dealing with them,

00:13:25.016 --> 00:13:28.685
we'll hop onto the highway and
make a beeline to the end of it.

00:13:28.752 --> 00:13:30.554
Then, we'll head
into the residential area

00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:32.389
and hide there
'til the next scan.

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:34.525
‐ Sounds like a plan.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.729
‐ If there's another team
within three klicks of us,

00:13:38.795 --> 00:13:41.065
there's a chance
we'll run into them.

00:13:43.534 --> 00:13:44.968
‐ Seven teams gone.

00:13:45.036 --> 00:13:46.870
That leaves 16 in play.

00:13:46.937 --> 00:13:48.239
[gasps] See that?

00:13:48.305 --> 00:13:50.941
There's three teams closing
on the pros and one straggler.

00:13:51.008 --> 00:13:55.579
‐ Guess you were right
about your luck. Good for us.

00:13:55.646 --> 00:13:58.415
Bad for those
other teams, though.

00:14:00.451 --> 00:14:02.519
‐ Well?
‐ Looks good.

00:14:02.586 --> 00:14:04.155
We'll wait
'til the fireworks start

00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:06.057
and then get
the hell out of here.

00:14:06.123 --> 00:14:07.058
‐ [giggles]

00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:09.926
[insects chirping]

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:12.496
‐ [automatic gunfire]
‐ [gasps]

00:14:12.563 --> 00:14:14.998
They found each other.

00:14:15.066 --> 00:14:17.368
‐ Time to move! Go! Go!

00:14:22.206 --> 00:14:24.675
‐ Is it okay I'm leaving you
behind like this?

00:14:24.741 --> 00:14:27.611
‐ [on radio] If I need you
to stop, I'll tell you.

00:14:27.678 --> 00:14:30.647
‐ [thinking] Wait. Is he
using me as a decoy again?

00:14:30.714 --> 00:14:32.483
I'm supposed to be
the team leader,

00:14:32.549 --> 00:14:34.818
and he's treating me
like a grunt.

00:14:41.925 --> 00:14:43.827
[shuffling]

00:14:43.894 --> 00:14:45.829
‐ [grunting]

00:14:56.473 --> 00:14:58.775
I can't believe
I made it out alive.

00:14:58.842 --> 00:15:02.613
Yo, dudes!
Anyone still alive out there?

00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:04.681
Man: Yeah! I'm still here.

00:15:04.748 --> 00:15:06.183
‐ Where?! Come on out!

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.986
Where you at? Let's get
the hell out of here already!

00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:13.290
‐ I think there's been
some confusion.

00:15:13.357 --> 00:15:16.460
I'm on the other team, dude.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.532
That was too easy.

00:15:21.598 --> 00:15:22.999
What a jackass.

00:15:23.067 --> 00:15:25.502
Should've checked his team stat
before calling out.

00:15:25.569 --> 00:15:28.472
Ah, looks like I'm
the only one left on‐‐

00:15:31.842 --> 00:15:34.178
‐ Like shooting fish
in a barrel.

00:15:34.245 --> 00:15:36.747
‐ Hanging back and letting
these bozos off each other

00:15:36.813 --> 00:15:38.315
is the only way to play!

00:15:38.382 --> 00:15:42.686
‐ Best part about battle royales
is killing fools like him.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.489
‐ Aw, man!
‐ Damn.

00:15:49.693 --> 00:15:52.463
‐ [radio]
Bravo, Charlie, this is Delta.

00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:54.231
Kitchen's clean.

00:15:54.298 --> 00:15:55.466
‐ Roger that, Delta.

00:15:55.532 --> 00:15:57.334
We'll check
the next scan from here.

00:15:57.401 --> 00:15:59.003
Stand by, and stay sharp. Over.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.739
‐ Yo, Chief, what do you want me
to do about that pink chick

00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:05.742
and Bigfoot hauling ass
down the highway. Take 'em?

00:16:11.648 --> 00:16:14.551
LLENN: Man, what a run!

00:16:14.618 --> 00:16:16.920
‐ Surprised we
didn't see anyone.

00:16:16.987 --> 00:16:18.122
‐ Or get shot.

00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:19.556
‐ Yeah.

00:16:19.623 --> 00:16:20.824
‐ When's the next scan?

00:16:20.891 --> 00:16:23.860
‐ It's coming up. Get ready.

00:16:27.764 --> 00:16:30.967
‐ Eight teams were killed
in the desert this time.

00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:33.270
‐ Probably fighting
for the central ruins there.

00:16:33.337 --> 00:16:35.106
It's a prime spot.

00:16:37.508 --> 00:16:38.742
‐ Amazing.

00:16:38.809 --> 00:16:41.378
‐ You talking about
the pro team's skill?

00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:43.314
‐ And your predictions.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.516
‐ Here we go. We're next.

00:16:47.918 --> 00:16:48.919
‐ No one.

00:16:48.985 --> 00:16:50.221
Thank goodness.

00:16:50.287 --> 00:16:51.922
‐ And that does it for the scan.

00:16:51.988 --> 00:16:54.958
It looks like 15 teams
have been killed off so far.

00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:56.793
That leaves eight, including us.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.895
Luck's definitely
on our side today.

00:16:58.962 --> 00:17:01.698
‐ Which of the other teams do
you think's gonna come after us?

00:17:01.765 --> 00:17:04.401
‐ There's two in the forest
that are close,

00:17:04.468 --> 00:17:05.769
but we can ignore them.

00:17:05.836 --> 00:17:08.172
Looks like they're having
a bit of a standoff.

00:17:08.239 --> 00:17:10.674
‐ If each one's waiting
for the other to make a move,

00:17:10.741 --> 00:17:12.309
they'll be there a long time.

00:17:12.376 --> 00:17:15.712
‐ I have a feeling this team'll
sneak up on them from behind.

00:17:15.779 --> 00:17:17.381
That'll shake things up.

00:17:17.448 --> 00:17:19.150
The team at the spaceship
in the marsh

00:17:19.216 --> 00:17:21.618
has the upper hand,
tactically speaking.

00:17:21.685 --> 00:17:23.720
If they're smart,
they'll stay put.

00:17:23.787 --> 00:17:25.822
‐ Hmm.
‐ As for the team in the desert

00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:27.258
and the one in the prairie,

00:17:27.324 --> 00:17:29.093
I don't know what
their next move's gonna be,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.862
especially the one
near the ruins.

00:17:31.928 --> 00:17:33.964
It's weird
they haven't entered them.

00:17:34.031 --> 00:17:35.766
It's a good place to dig in.

00:17:35.832 --> 00:17:38.469
‐ Mm‐hmm. I was just thinking
the same thing.

00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:41.472
‐ Let's not worry about them
'til the next scan.

00:17:41.538 --> 00:17:43.874
We got bigger fish to fry
right here.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.876
‐ Yeah you're right,
the pro team.

00:17:45.942 --> 00:17:49.580
‐ If they're not in this to win,
but for combat experience,

00:17:49.646 --> 00:17:51.748
they won't wait
for others to come to them.

00:17:51.815 --> 00:17:54.418
They'll go after
the closest team, us.

00:17:54.485 --> 00:17:58.789
‐ Well, now what're we gonna do?
We can't beat pro soldiers.

00:17:58.855 --> 00:18:02.626
‐ Well, if we play
our cards right,

00:18:02.693 --> 00:18:04.495
there's a good chance we can.

00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:05.496
‐ Really?!

00:18:05.562 --> 00:18:07.264
‐ Your size, speed and agility

00:18:07.331 --> 00:18:09.733
might give us the advantage,
if you're up for it.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.935
‐ [laughs] Sure!
I'm up for anything!

00:18:12.003 --> 00:18:14.038
Come on!
Tell me the plan already!

00:18:14.105 --> 00:18:15.039
‐ All right.

00:18:15.106 --> 00:18:16.873
You got it.

00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:19.676
‐ If we're gonna beat
the next scan,

00:18:19.743 --> 00:18:21.378
we need to hustle.

00:18:21.445 --> 00:18:23.347
New orders, people.

00:18:24.848 --> 00:18:26.817
We got ten minutes
to get our asses

00:18:26.883 --> 00:18:28.719
to the residential district.

00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:31.355
[radio] Spotted a team of two

00:18:31.422 --> 00:18:32.689
on the highway headed there,

00:18:32.756 --> 00:18:35.526
a pink munchkin
and some big guy,

00:18:35.592 --> 00:18:37.794
types of weapons unknown.

00:18:43.134 --> 00:18:45.002
Scan in 40.

00:18:46.103 --> 00:18:47.904
Everybody hold.

00:18:49.473 --> 00:18:50.807
Stay alert.

00:18:50.874 --> 00:18:52.943
[timer beeping]

00:18:56.147 --> 00:18:57.214
Scan starting.

00:18:59.383 --> 00:19:00.317
Huh.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.490
Damn. They're close,
due north, 80 meters!

00:19:06.557 --> 00:19:07.891
‐ I don't see anyone.

00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.893
‐ I got nothing
on my end, either.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.265
‐ Same here. No vehicles
in the intersection.

00:19:14.331 --> 00:19:15.866
‐ Move up.

00:19:15.932 --> 00:19:17.834
Team: Roger that.

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:24.441
‐ Scan doesn't show elevation.

00:19:24.508 --> 00:19:27.544
They could be hiding
down a manhole in front of you.

00:19:27.611 --> 00:19:28.579
Watch your six.

00:19:28.645 --> 00:19:30.347
‐ We're there.

00:19:30.414 --> 00:19:33.317
I'm looking, Chief.
I don't see any manholes.

00:19:33.384 --> 00:19:37.521
‐ Facing northwest on my end.
No manholes here.

00:19:37.588 --> 00:19:38.822
Zero movement, sir.

00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:40.624
Clear to the northeast.

00:19:40.691 --> 00:19:42.226
No enemies,
no manholes, nothing.

00:19:42.293 --> 00:19:44.128
‐ I'm clear to the north,
too, Chief.

00:19:44.195 --> 00:19:45.462
There's no enemies in sight.

00:19:46.897 --> 00:19:50.000
Yo, Chief,
these scans ever make mistakes?

00:19:50.067 --> 00:19:53.337
‐ That's a negative.
The scans are always solid.

00:19:53.404 --> 00:19:56.107
Call out everything you guys
see in the intersection.

00:19:56.173 --> 00:20:00.244
‐ Some cracks in the road,
a rusty bike on the ground.

00:20:00.311 --> 00:20:03.847
‐ I see a civvy car tire
lying on its side,

00:20:03.914 --> 00:20:06.183
two broken branches
in the street,

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.086
a dirty suitcase, an empty can.

00:20:09.153 --> 00:20:10.854
Scratch that. Three cans.

00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:14.991
‐ I got a shopping cart
over here, nothing in it.

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:16.960
No holes in the ground.

00:20:17.028 --> 00:20:19.296
‐ There's nothing out here
but us, Chief.

00:20:19.363 --> 00:20:20.364
‐ [groans]

00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:23.934
Son of a‐‐

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.969
The suitcase! Light it up!

00:20:32.543 --> 00:20:35.279
M: Forty‐five degrees right,
Seven meters ahead.

00:20:41.252 --> 00:20:42.886
‐ [yells]

00:20:44.488 --> 00:20:47.524
M: If you take someone down,
use their corpse for a shield.

00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:50.894
In Squad Jam, a dead body
becomes an "Immortal Object,"

00:20:50.961 --> 00:20:52.929
so you can use it for cover
under fire.

00:20:52.996 --> 00:20:55.099
‐ Crap! She's so small!

00:21:01.772 --> 00:21:03.240
‐ Little runt!

00:21:05.309 --> 00:21:07.044
[gasps, growls]

00:21:12.916 --> 00:21:15.252
[gasps] Aw, come on!

00:21:21.058 --> 00:21:24.261
‐ We're done. No need to engage.

00:21:24.328 --> 00:21:26.430
‐ It's probably for the better.

00:21:30.667 --> 00:21:33.937
‐ That's not real‐world speed.
It's the game.

00:21:34.005 --> 00:21:35.806
It's no good to us.

00:21:35.872 --> 00:21:37.508
Eh, training's over for today.

00:21:37.574 --> 00:21:39.843
Pulling the plug.

00:21:48.619 --> 00:21:49.553
‐ Awesome!

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.821
‐ Talk about fast.

00:21:50.887 --> 00:21:52.556
‐ She took out all those pros.

00:21:52.623 --> 00:21:54.291
‐ No wonder she's so famous.

00:21:54.358 --> 00:21:56.360
‐ I still can't believe
she did it.

00:21:56.427 --> 00:21:59.530
‐ And we know who LLENN is
in real life.

00:21:59.596 --> 00:22:02.199
You rock, Karen!

00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:06.170
‐ [chuckles] Come on, guys.
You're embarrassing me.
