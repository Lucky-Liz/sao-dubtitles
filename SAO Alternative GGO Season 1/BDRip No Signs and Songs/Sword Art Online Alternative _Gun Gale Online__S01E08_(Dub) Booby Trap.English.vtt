‐ [squeals]

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:06.511
‐ [chuckles]

00:00:06.577 --> 00:00:08.146
‐ [thinking] No more doubts.

00:00:08.213 --> 00:00:09.547
I got this.

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:14.052
Watch out, Pito. I'm coming.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.487
[buzzer sounds]

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:20.791
Announcer: Squad Jam 2 is on!

00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:24.762
[whoosh]

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:30.568
‐ Suburbs.

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:33.304
‐ Hey, LLENN,
look at that big old wall.

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:34.339
‐ Eh?

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:37.042
It must be the boundary.

00:00:37.108 --> 00:00:38.943
‐ Oh, right.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.811
No one's getting over that,

00:00:40.878 --> 00:00:43.981
well, not unless
they're 100 feet tall, anyway.

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:46.551
‐ I wonder if it goes
all the way around the map.

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:48.719
‐ Let's see. Where are we?

00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:51.456
Oh! There we are,
way up in the corner.

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:52.957
Look. Railroad tracks.

00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:55.060
That's right.
You can use vehicles here.

00:00:55.126 --> 00:00:57.462
Let's fire up the train
and take it somewhere.

00:00:57.528 --> 00:00:58.796
‐ Where do you wanna take it?

00:00:58.863 --> 00:01:01.232
‐ I don't know.
The city, I guess.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.034
Yeah, and go shop for clothes.

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:05.370
‐ We'll go shopping
after I kill Pito.

00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:06.737
‐ Roger that.

00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:08.306
‐ So we're here.

00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:12.077
‐ Yup, so now what?
Which way do you wanna go?

00:01:12.143 --> 00:01:13.944
‐ That hilly area
looks dangerous.

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:15.246
It's perfect for snipers

00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:17.548
'cause of all
the vantage points it has.

00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:19.217
We should stay clear of it.

00:01:19.284 --> 00:01:20.585
‐ Yes, ma'am!

00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:23.154
‐ Uh...
‐ What's the big round thing?

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.689
A baseball stadium?

00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:26.857
‐ Are they as big as that?

00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:30.928
‐ Since G.G.O. takes place in
the future, maybe they will be.

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:33.331
‐ Oh, look.
Some kind of building.

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:38.036
It could either be a factory
or a school. I don't know.

00:01:38.103 --> 00:01:41.506
And right below that,
there's a rocky mountain range.

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:43.874
Well? Did you memorize
the terrain?

00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:45.843
‐ Wait! I have
to remember all that?!

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.979
I didn't have to memorize maps
back in A.L.O.

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:51.549
If I wanted to go anywhere,
I flew.

00:01:51.616 --> 00:01:53.251
I don't wanna get lost.

00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:54.685
‐ No, no worries.
‐ Huh?

00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:56.887
‐ I think I got it all.
‐ Really?

00:01:56.954 --> 00:01:59.224
‐ You can look at the map
anytime during the game,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.626
but we'll be going fast,
so try to keep track

00:02:01.692 --> 00:02:03.528
of where you are
as best you can.

00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:05.596
If we get separated,
call and stay put.

00:02:05.663 --> 00:02:07.332
‐ Uh...

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.034
roger that.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.938
‐ [thinking]
It's been four minutes.

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:17.142
We'll wait here
until the first scan happens.

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:20.111
I want to make sure
there are no enemies nearby.

00:02:20.178 --> 00:02:22.213
Once we know it's clear,
we'll head out,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.982
avoid the other teams
as much as possible,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.085
and make our way to Pito.

00:02:27.152 --> 00:02:30.288
And as soon as I find her,
I'll kill her.

00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:03.950
LLENN: It's clear where I'm at.

00:04:04.017 --> 00:04:06.286
‐ [radio] Same. God, I'm bored.

00:04:06.353 --> 00:04:09.222
‐ Scan's coming up, so check
your Terminal for enemies.

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:11.191
If they're close,
get ready to run.

00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:14.261
‐ You got it.
I'll tap some of the dots, too,

00:04:14.327 --> 00:04:16.729
and I'll let you know
if I find your friend.

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:18.365
Leave it to me.

00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:20.200
[Terminal beeping]

00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:26.839
‐ No enemies on this block,
thank God.

00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:30.410
Pito could be any of these dots.
I wonder which one.

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:32.545
[gasps] Don't tell me.

00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:40.187
‐ Well, that sucks.

00:04:40.253 --> 00:04:43.256
LLENN and her partner
are the farthest away.

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.896
Boss: LLENN got dropped
on the northwest edge,

00:04:49.962 --> 00:04:51.164
eight klicks north of us.

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:54.267
‐ What should we do?
‐ [sighs]

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:58.871
We'll hit the closest team to us
and make our way up to her.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.109
[wind blowing]

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.251
‐ They stuck the favorites
in opposite corners.

00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:14.354
‐ That's such B.S.

00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:18.125
Of all the teams, why'd they
drop hers the farthest away?

00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:23.230
[wails]

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.734
‐ [deeper voice] Young lady,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.304
life doesn't always work out
the way you want it to.

00:05:31.371 --> 00:05:35.008
All you can do is rise
to the challenge and carry on,

00:05:35.075 --> 00:05:37.477
just like you've been doing.

00:05:38.778 --> 00:05:40.413
Or was that just luck?

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.449
‐ Okay, okay.

00:05:42.515 --> 00:05:43.950
You made your point.

00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:47.120
We're gonna head
for the southeast,

00:05:47.187 --> 00:05:50.857
and if anyone gets in our way,
we're gonna crush 'em.

00:05:56.063 --> 00:05:59.032
[running footsteps]

00:06:03.503 --> 00:06:04.737
I'm clear on this end.

00:06:04.804 --> 00:06:06.706
‐ [radio] Heading over.

00:06:06.773 --> 00:06:09.142
‐ Come on, come on.
Where are they?

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:11.411
They gotta be
around here somewhere.

00:06:11.478 --> 00:06:12.645
[thinking] There.

00:06:17.717 --> 00:06:20.487
I'll circle around
and hit them from behind.

00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:21.488
‐ Got it.

00:06:21.554 --> 00:06:23.456
‐ Distract 'em for me.

00:06:23.523 --> 00:06:24.991
‐ This is gonna be great.

00:06:25.058 --> 00:06:26.526
Those fools won't know
what hit 'em.

00:06:26.593 --> 00:06:29.162
The Ambush Fairy and
Grenade Fairy are gonna

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.898
blast 'em to kingdom‐‐Uh‐oh.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.268
‐ Fuka!

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:40.240
‐ [wails] I blew it!

00:06:41.308 --> 00:06:42.042
[scraping]

00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:45.612
[sobs] I'm sorry!

00:06:45.678 --> 00:06:47.247
‐ No, I'm sorry.

00:06:47.314 --> 00:06:50.183
I forgot to tell you to
watch out for traps out there.

00:06:51.184 --> 00:06:52.919
Man: No bodies. Nothing.

00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:54.321
Man #2: Where'd they go?

00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:56.289
‐ [thinking]
It's going to take two minutes

00:06:56.356 --> 00:06:58.025
before her legs grow back.

00:06:58.091 --> 00:06:59.392
Man #3: ...couldn't
have gotten far.

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.395
‐ Leave me. Get out of here
before they find you.

00:07:02.462 --> 00:07:03.930
‐ I'll go when you're dead.

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:05.298
‐ Dang, you're cold.

00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:06.766
‐ Stay clear of the window.

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:08.301
Get down as low as you can.

00:07:08.368 --> 00:07:10.737
I'm the champion
of S.J., remember?

00:07:10.803 --> 00:07:13.040
I can handle these guys.

00:07:21.283 --> 00:07:22.217
‐ That's one.

00:07:22.284 --> 00:07:23.753
Two.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.861
There's three.

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:36.331
[man panting]

00:07:36.398 --> 00:07:38.233
[shrieks]

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:52.715
[gasps]

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.451
[launcher pops]

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:57.820
Nice shot, Fuka.

00:07:57.887 --> 00:07:59.121
‐ You know me.

00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:01.423
I'm the kind of girl
who loves payback,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.958
the more brutal, the better.

00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:05.761
‐ [crowd cheering]
‐ Holy crap!

00:08:05.828 --> 00:08:07.997
No wonder
that team's top‐ranked!

00:08:08.063 --> 00:08:11.701
‐ She hit him right in the face
with a friggin' grenade!

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:13.168
I think I'm in love.

00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:16.305
‐ That knife to the nuts
was a little overboard, though.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:17.472
‐ Agreed.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:18.941
‐ That was amazing, wasn't it?

00:08:19.008 --> 00:08:20.843
Yes, sirree, that's what you get

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.112
when you go head‐to‐head
against my LLENN.

00:08:23.178 --> 00:08:28.984
‐ She is rad, but just so we're
clear here, she ain't yours.

00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:33.588
‐ Aw, yeah!

00:08:33.655 --> 00:08:35.424
Bullets for days, yo!

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.160
God damn, I love my machine gun.

00:08:40.162 --> 00:08:43.032
Lax: Six bodies confirmed.
They're out.

00:08:43.098 --> 00:08:45.000
Man: No other enemies
in the area.

00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:48.170
‐ Roger that.
We'll wait for the next scan.

00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:50.605
If it's clear,
let's get off this mountain.

00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:52.174
Reload, and stay sharp.

00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:55.144
No one moves
'til I give the word.

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:59.014
[automatic weapons firing]

00:09:03.518 --> 00:09:07.622
Boss: We got this! Keep on
pounding 'em! Don't let up!

00:09:07.689 --> 00:09:10.159
Eat lead, you bastards!

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:17.066
‐ They got three of ours.
Fall back, and regroup!

00:09:18.033 --> 00:09:20.069
Big ugly one's sniping at us.

00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:21.070
[yelps]

00:09:22.905 --> 00:09:24.506
‐ [chuckles]

00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:26.141
Should have ducked.

00:09:28.978 --> 00:09:32.948
Man: What the hell?
I can't see it.

00:09:33.015 --> 00:09:34.784
There's no Bullet Line.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.585
How the hell
am I supposed to know

00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:37.787
which direct‐‐

00:09:39.588 --> 00:09:41.490
‐ Yeah I did it! I got him!

00:09:41.556 --> 00:09:43.025
‐ You got the hang of it now.

00:09:43.092 --> 00:09:46.095
‐ Shirley, why didn't you
take a shot? You missed out.

00:09:46.161 --> 00:09:48.530
‐ No, that's okay.

00:09:48.597 --> 00:09:50.232
Maybe next time.

00:09:52.768 --> 00:09:55.037
Pito: This is so boring.

00:09:55.104 --> 00:09:57.039
What are we doing, M?

00:09:57.106 --> 00:09:59.008
We can't just stay here
picking our butts

00:09:59.074 --> 00:10:00.609
while everyone
blasts away down there.

00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:03.445
Come on. Let's get off
this mountain already.

00:10:03.512 --> 00:10:04.613
‐ Not yet.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:05.815
‐ Why's that?

00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:07.449
No, wait. Let me guess.

00:10:07.516 --> 00:10:10.085
It's 'cause you don't
wanna fight, isn't it?

00:10:10.152 --> 00:10:12.788
Yeah, you just wanna
chicken out like last time.

00:10:12.855 --> 00:10:14.389
‐ I have a plan.

00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:15.891
‐ [sighs]

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.692
What do you guys wanna do?

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.929
‐ Contract says
we follow orders.

00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:22.832
The leader says stay, we stay.

00:10:22.898 --> 00:10:24.834
‐ Ecch. You party‐poopers.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.003
‐ We don't need to engage
in random battles.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.806
There's a chance
you might get picked off.

00:10:30.873 --> 00:10:32.374
Do you wanna die like that?

00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:36.712
‐ No. But I don't wanna die
of boredom, either.

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:38.547
[grunts] I'm getting antsy.

00:10:38.613 --> 00:10:40.415
‐ I know, but be patient.

00:10:40.482 --> 00:10:43.853
Like I said before,
I do have a plan, okay?

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:46.055
You wanted me
to be the leader here,

00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:47.522
so follow my lead.

00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:49.624
‐ All right, "sir."

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:51.160
Whatever you say.

00:10:51.226 --> 00:10:54.529
But the second you die,
I'm going on a killing spree.

00:10:54.596 --> 00:10:56.198
‐ Have fun with that.

00:10:56.265 --> 00:10:59.568
You'll be taking on the most
vicious player by yourself.

00:10:59.634 --> 00:11:00.903
‐ And who might that be?

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.007
‐ You know who.
Your friend, LLENN.

00:11:05.074 --> 00:11:07.777
That pink bunny's fangs
are sharper now,

00:11:07.843 --> 00:11:09.578
and she's hungry
for your blood.

00:11:12.982 --> 00:11:15.084
‐ [laughs]

00:11:15.652 --> 00:11:16.887
[whoosh]

00:11:16.954 --> 00:11:19.490
[Fuka yelling]

00:11:19.556 --> 00:11:20.291
[laughs]

00:11:20.357 --> 00:11:23.460
Yes! My legs grew back!

00:11:23.527 --> 00:11:24.861
Thank God!

00:11:24.929 --> 00:11:26.363
My HP's topped off, too,

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.065
thanks to my handy‐dandy medkit.

00:11:28.132 --> 00:11:30.734
Whoo‐hoo! Welcome back, legs!

00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:33.670
♪ I got my legs back,
I got my legs back ♪

00:11:33.737 --> 00:11:36.773
♪ I got my legs back,
I got my legs back ♪

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.343
I won't screw up
like that again! No, sir!

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.845
I'm gonna watch
my step from now on!

00:11:41.913 --> 00:11:43.547
Hear that, boys? I'm back,

00:11:43.614 --> 00:11:45.549
so set all
the tripwires you want.

00:11:45.616 --> 00:11:47.518
I'll just hop right over 'em.

00:11:47.584 --> 00:11:49.720
‐ Yeah, well, be careful
where you're hopping,

00:11:49.786 --> 00:11:52.756
'cause tripwires
can be at waist level
and head height, too.

00:11:52.823 --> 00:11:55.126
There are even traps
that you're supposed to find,

00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:57.694
just to make you step
into another one nearby.

00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:00.097
‐ A trap for a trap, huh?

00:12:00.164 --> 00:12:03.067
That's like
beyond playing dirty.

00:12:03.134 --> 00:12:04.768
‐ That's how you survive G.G.O.

00:12:04.835 --> 00:12:07.871
You'll get used to it,
eventually. I got used to it,

00:12:07.939 --> 00:12:11.175
and now I'm checking doorways
for wires in real life, too.

00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:14.345
‐ My best friend's
turned into a commando,

00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:16.747
and I couldn't be happier.

00:12:16.813 --> 00:12:19.483
‐ Get ready.
The scan's about to start.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.484
‐ Ready.

00:12:24.588 --> 00:12:25.656
‐ Here we go.

00:12:25.722 --> 00:12:27.091
‐ There's PM4.

00:12:27.158 --> 00:12:29.126
‐ I'm glad they're still alive,

00:12:29.193 --> 00:12:31.195
but it doesn't look
like they moved.

00:12:31.262 --> 00:12:32.796
‐ All right, what's the plan?

00:12:32.863 --> 00:12:35.532
‐ Let's go after the team
at the train station,

00:12:35.599 --> 00:12:37.368
right there.
It's the middle of town,

00:12:37.434 --> 00:12:39.203
so we can find
a good vantage point.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.973
They're on the tracks
between platforms.

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:43.340
Good cover for them,

00:12:43.407 --> 00:12:45.910
since the platforms
are concrete and bulletproof.

00:12:45.977 --> 00:12:47.778
It's like a little fortress.

00:12:47.844 --> 00:12:50.314
‐ They're just gonna
sit there and wait?

00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:51.748
Those chickens.

00:12:51.815 --> 00:12:54.251
I know.
Let's run 'em over with a train.

00:12:54.318 --> 00:12:55.886
‐ We don't know
how to drive one.

00:12:55.953 --> 00:12:58.522
Look, we'll sneak up
using the houses for cover.

00:12:58.589 --> 00:13:02.326
‐ I was thinking. I still
feel bad about the last team,

00:13:02.393 --> 00:13:03.860
so to make up for it,

00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:06.297
how 'bout you let me
deal with these guys?

00:13:06.363 --> 00:13:08.499
‐ I don't know.
Do you have a plan or something?

00:13:08.565 --> 00:13:11.268
‐ Yeah. This time,
I'll do the shooting,

00:13:11.335 --> 00:13:14.538
and you do the relaxing.
[laughs]

00:13:16.273 --> 00:13:18.342
Boss: Ten minutes
'til the next scan,

00:13:18.409 --> 00:13:20.945
and not one team's in range.

00:13:21.012 --> 00:13:23.880
Not one. Damn!

00:13:23.948 --> 00:13:25.116
[groans]

00:13:25.182 --> 00:13:26.583
[echoing]
You assholes!

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.453
Doesn't anyone have
the balls to face us?!

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.588
[echo] ...to face us?!
...to face us?!

00:13:31.655 --> 00:13:32.389
...to face us?

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:34.158
‐ What a potty mouth.

00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:35.960
I never heard you
swear like that before.

00:13:36.027 --> 00:13:39.663
‐ So what? It's a game.
I'm not hurting anyone.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.233
It is called role‐playing,
after all.

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:44.936
‐ Actually, if you
get used to swearing here,

00:13:45.002 --> 00:13:47.704
there's a chance you'll do it
in the real world, too.

00:13:47.771 --> 00:13:50.674
I'd be embarrassed
if you did that on the subway.

00:13:50.741 --> 00:13:51.976
‐ [gasps]

00:13:52.043 --> 00:13:54.211
Yeah, you're right.

00:13:54.278 --> 00:13:55.446
‐ I know.

00:13:55.512 --> 00:13:57.448
Sophie: You could still
taunt the others.

00:13:57.514 --> 00:13:59.883
Just try to be
more elegant about it.

00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:01.152
‐ Okay.

00:14:01.218 --> 00:14:02.519
[clears throat]

00:14:02.586 --> 00:14:04.188

00:14:04.255 --> 00:14:07.558
Does no one have

[wind blowing]

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:16.033
‐ SHINC and PM4's
a ways away.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.868
LF's even farther out.

00:14:17.935 --> 00:14:18.869
That settles it.

00:14:18.936 --> 00:14:20.905
We're heading west.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.577
[Pito groans] This sucks.

00:14:26.643 --> 00:14:29.846
I wish she'd come
and kill me already.

00:14:29.914 --> 00:14:31.148
[groans]

00:14:31.215 --> 00:14:34.585
Hurry up, LLENN.

00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:44.361
‐ Good. It's clear.

00:14:44.428 --> 00:14:47.231
‐ All right. I am so ready.

00:14:47.298 --> 00:14:48.632
Which way do I point?

00:14:48.699 --> 00:14:49.633
‐ Um...

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.401
that way,

00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:52.503
about 300 meters, give or take.

00:14:52.569 --> 00:14:55.006
‐ [chuckles]
This is gonna be hot.

00:14:55.072 --> 00:14:57.174
Let's do this.

00:14:57.241 --> 00:14:59.343
Okay, LLENN, get to it.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.079
‐ Yup. See ya.
Talk to you in a bit.

00:15:08.419 --> 00:15:09.453
[launcher pops]

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.487
‐ What was that?

00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:13.424
‐ Sounded like someone farted.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.626
Holy crap, that was a grenade!

00:15:15.692 --> 00:15:17.728
‐ Would you chill?
That wasn't even close.

00:15:17.794 --> 00:15:19.663
They're just firing
in this direction, is all.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.664
[team gasps]

00:15:24.268 --> 00:15:27.504
Close. Aim five meters
to the north of that last shot.

00:15:27.571 --> 00:15:28.973
‐ Roger that.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.974
[launcher pops]

00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:33.277
‐ Two down.

00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:36.813
‐ I'll launch grenades at 'em
from a safe distance.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.216
They won't see me,
'cause of the houses,

00:15:39.283 --> 00:15:41.085
but I won't see them, either.

00:15:41.152 --> 00:15:42.319
That's where you come in.

00:15:42.386 --> 00:15:44.055
Find someplace high,
and spot for me.

00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:46.991
Every time I shoot,
tell me how far off I was,

00:15:47.058 --> 00:15:48.392
and I'll adjust my aim.

00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:50.694
‐ Okay, but can you
hit 'em like that?

00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:52.696
‐ Hah! Can I hit 'em?

00:15:52.763 --> 00:15:55.432
Do you know how many hours
I spent practicing?

00:15:55.499 --> 00:15:56.733
‐ I don't know.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.801
‐ A lot.

00:15:57.868 --> 00:16:00.137
Look, who says you
have to fight eye to eye?

00:16:00.204 --> 00:16:01.605
These kind of weapons

00:16:01.672 --> 00:16:03.740
are all about getting 'em
when they least expect it.

00:16:03.807 --> 00:16:05.742
I practiced
by setting up targets,

00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:08.312
measuring distances,
and shooting by feel.

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:10.247
I got pretty darn good
at it, too.

00:16:10.314 --> 00:16:11.482
Just give me a distance,

00:16:11.548 --> 00:16:13.617
and I can hit anything
with my eyes closed.

00:16:13.684 --> 00:16:16.687
All I need is a person
giving me accurate info.

00:16:17.821 --> 00:16:18.923
‐ Get down.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.891
I'll do it,
but you'll be a sitting duck,

00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.693
and if someone spots you,
you're dead.

00:16:22.759 --> 00:16:25.862
‐ I was pretty much dead
a little while ago,

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.732
but I bounced right back
like a zombie.

00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:33.204
‐ I see one guy 18 meters up
from your last shot.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.438
‐ 18 up.

00:16:37.174 --> 00:16:38.976
[explosions]

00:16:41.012 --> 00:16:41.946
‐ Got him.

00:16:44.381 --> 00:16:46.817
Two are up and running
along the track,

00:16:46.883 --> 00:16:48.552
five meters down from the last.

00:16:48.619 --> 00:16:50.955
‐ Oh, those guys are toast.

00:16:56.293 --> 00:16:57.228
LLENN: They're out.

00:16:57.294 --> 00:16:59.063
One more to go.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.398
He's over the platform,
heading due east.

00:17:01.465 --> 00:17:04.601
He's fast, so if you
can't hit him, no worries.

00:17:04.668 --> 00:17:07.571
‐ Huh! I'll waste him
with a six‐pack attack!

00:17:10.241 --> 00:17:11.175
Here I go.

00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:26.190
‐ Yes, Fuka!

00:17:26.257 --> 00:17:28.125
You got him! You got 'em all!

00:17:28.192 --> 00:17:31.362
You're a genius with
those guns! That was amazing.

00:17:31.428 --> 00:17:33.330
That was beautiful!

00:17:33.397 --> 00:17:35.699
Yeah, I know!

00:17:35.766 --> 00:17:39.236
Hmm. See what
a little grinding can do?

00:17:40.504 --> 00:17:41.605
‐ Let's get to the station

00:17:41.672 --> 00:17:42.639
for the next scan.

00:17:42.706 --> 00:17:45.309
Check your map.

00:17:45.376 --> 00:17:47.644
We'll head for the dome next.

00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:50.881
[crowd cheering]

00:17:53.717 --> 00:17:56.820
‐ She took out that whole team
with just her grenades.

00:17:56.887 --> 00:17:58.990
‐ She's a beast
with those hand cannons.

00:17:59.056 --> 00:18:01.525
‐ You see that?
There's not a team out there

00:18:01.592 --> 00:18:03.794
that can match
the little blonde and my LLENN.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.130
Both: Dude, she ain't yours!

00:18:06.197 --> 00:18:08.499
‐ [Terminal beeping]
‐ [thinking] Don't be dead!

00:18:11.302 --> 00:18:12.236
Yes.

00:18:12.303 --> 00:18:13.670
Huh? Oh, my gosh.

00:18:13.737 --> 00:18:16.473
‐ What are those seven teams
all doing there?

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.742
I mean, they can't
not see each other.

00:18:18.809 --> 00:18:20.244
What do you think they're up to?

00:18:20.311 --> 00:18:22.146
‐ Something bad.

00:18:22.213 --> 00:18:23.747
‐ [chuckles]

00:18:23.814 --> 00:18:27.551
Pito, check this out.
You'll love it.

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:29.353
[running footsteps]

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.787
Fuka: Are you gonna tell me

00:18:30.854 --> 00:18:32.323
‐ what's going on?
‐ Those teams near Pito,

00:18:32.389 --> 00:18:34.558
that's what.
They're working together now.

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:36.860
‐ Huh? Why would they do that?

00:18:36.928 --> 00:18:38.930
‐ There's only one reason
I can think of!

00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:41.898
I bet someone called
for a cease‐fire.

00:18:41.966 --> 00:18:44.168
Whoever it is must be
a good negotiator,

00:18:44.235 --> 00:18:47.838
'cause they convinced
all those teams to join forces.

00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:50.641
Now they're in command
of an army of dozens of people,

00:18:50.707 --> 00:18:52.076
and I bet you anything

00:18:52.143 --> 00:18:54.411
they're on their way
to attack M and Pito.

00:18:54.478 --> 00:18:57.648
‐ Ohh! Yeah,
that's pretty clever!

00:18:58.649 --> 00:19:00.351
Anna: That is so lame.

00:19:00.417 --> 00:19:01.452
I mean, really?

00:19:01.518 --> 00:19:03.120
Boss: They're a pathetic bunch.

00:19:03.187 --> 00:19:04.221
That's for sure.

00:19:04.288 --> 00:19:05.556
Roza: Do they actually think

00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:07.691
throwing bodies at that team
will help 'em?

00:19:07.758 --> 00:19:09.994
Boss: You never know.
There's strength in numbers,

00:19:10.061 --> 00:19:12.263
and right now,
they have the numbers.

00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:16.367
Sure, M's an amazing player,
and he does have that shield,

00:19:16.433 --> 00:19:20.404
but if he gets surrounded,
it's not gonna do him any good.

00:19:20.471 --> 00:19:21.838
Maybe he'll survive.

00:19:21.906 --> 00:19:24.641
We won't know
'til the shooting stops.

00:19:26.243 --> 00:19:29.746
David: Well, that's some
kind of strategy.

00:19:29.813 --> 00:19:31.282
I'm a little disappointed

00:19:31.348 --> 00:19:33.317
they didn't ask us
to join them, though.

00:19:33.384 --> 00:19:37.221
‐ Wait. You'd be cool trooping
with those goons? Seriously?

00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:40.724
‐ Not even. We'd play along
until the time was right

00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:42.726
and then slaughter everyone.

00:19:42.793 --> 00:19:44.895
It's a battle royale, after all,

00:19:44.962 --> 00:19:48.332
and there's no such thing
as allies here.

00:19:52.636 --> 00:19:54.238
‐ They all teamed up.

00:19:54.305 --> 00:19:56.840
That sucks. Why didn't they
ask us to join 'em?

00:19:56.908 --> 00:19:58.409
‐ So what's the plan now?

00:19:58.475 --> 00:20:01.045
‐ I wanna see what happens
to those saps they're after.

00:20:01.112 --> 00:20:04.348
We'll stay out of sight until
they're done killing each other.

00:20:05.516 --> 00:20:07.651
‐ [running footsteps]
‐ [panting]

00:20:21.098 --> 00:20:24.068
[thinking] Seven teams,
that's 42 people max.

00:20:24.135 --> 00:20:26.470
Pito's in some real trouble.
What do I do?

00:20:26.537 --> 00:20:28.005
What do I do? What do I do?

00:20:28.072 --> 00:20:29.106
[yelps]

00:20:29.173 --> 00:20:30.807
[grunting]

00:20:30.874 --> 00:20:33.710
‐ Would you calm down?
You wanna break your neck

00:20:33.777 --> 00:20:35.412
and kill yourself
out of the tourney?

00:20:35.479 --> 00:20:37.814
‐ [groans]

00:20:37.881 --> 00:20:40.084
‐ Freaking out
won't help anyone.

00:20:40.151 --> 00:20:42.954
‐ I know! But no matter
how good Pito and M are,

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.821
they're way outnumbered.

00:20:44.888 --> 00:20:47.224
‐ Okay, what's the chance
of you getting there

00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:49.293
if you ran like crazy?

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.863
‐ Even if I ran full speed,
I wouldn't make it in time.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.698
‐ If they're as sharp
as you say,

00:20:54.765 --> 00:20:55.967
I bet you they'll bail

00:20:56.033 --> 00:20:57.834
once they see
it's a no‐win situation.

00:20:57.902 --> 00:21:00.271
They'll be fine. You'll see.

00:21:00.337 --> 00:21:03.374
‐ [groans] I sure
hope you're right.

00:21:04.575 --> 00:21:07.744
Pito, you better not die yet.

00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:10.247
I'm supposed to kill you.

00:21:12.683 --> 00:21:14.818
[Pito laughing wildly]

00:21:17.421 --> 00:21:19.890
[laughing continues]

00:21:24.128 --> 00:21:26.597
Oh, they're so clever!

00:21:26.663 --> 00:21:27.999
[laughs]

00:21:28.065 --> 00:21:30.334
This is the best thing ever.

00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:32.036
[laughs]

00:21:32.103 --> 00:21:34.205
‐ Man: Uh, shouldn't we retreat?
‐ Huh?

00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:36.407
‐ There's a hell
of a lot more of those guys

00:21:36.473 --> 00:21:37.608
than there are of us.

00:21:37.674 --> 00:21:40.477
I mean, the odds
ain't in our favor.

00:21:40.544 --> 00:21:41.812
What should we do?

00:21:41.878 --> 00:21:44.815
‐ Are you kidding me?
That's obvious.

00:21:50.387 --> 00:21:55.226
We'll set up an ambush and
wipe out every last one of 'em.

00:21:55.292 --> 00:21:57.228
[laughing]

00:22:00.297 --> 00:22:02.233
[laughter echoing]
