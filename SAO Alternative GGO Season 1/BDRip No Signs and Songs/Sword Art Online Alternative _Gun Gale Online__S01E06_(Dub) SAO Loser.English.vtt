WEBVTT

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:05.610
LLENN: They have it!

00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:08.413
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.150
I'll take it, mister, right now!
You don't even need to bag it!

00:00:12.217 --> 00:00:13.984
Oh, I love you.

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:16.654
I didn't think
I'd ever find you again.

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:18.656
Now then, what to call you.

00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:21.759
P‐chan two?
Or P‐chan the second?

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:24.029
No, we're just
gonna go with P‐chan.

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:27.732
Ohh. I can't wait
to go shooting with you, P‐chan.

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:30.868
♪ P‐chan, P‐chan,
the best in town ♪

00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:33.671
♪ Every minute,
shoot 900 rounds ♪

00:00:33.738 --> 00:00:36.741
♪ Listen to the brass
go plink, plink, plink ♪

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:37.642
Oh.

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:40.278
Boss: How's it goin', shrimp?

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:16.276
Girls: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

00:02:16.343 --> 00:02:17.644
Peek‐a‐boo!

00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:20.480
‐ Awesome!

00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:21.914
‐ Man, talk about fast.

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:23.883
‐ She took out all those pros.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.752
‐ No wonder she's so famous.

00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:27.654
‐ I still can't believe
she did it.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.523
‐ And we know who LLENN is
in real life.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.792
You rock, Karen!

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.496
‐ [chuckles] Come on, guys.
You're embarrassing me.

00:02:36.563 --> 00:02:39.099
‐ Why? You have
the best moves ever!

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:41.734
‐ Thanks, but they're
not my moves. They're LLENN's.

00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:43.270
‐ That's totally the same thing.

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:46.006
You control your avatar's moves,
after all.

00:02:46.073 --> 00:02:48.941
Without you, LLENN wouldn't be
as amazing as she is,

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.244
so you're the real winner
of Squad Jam.

00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:53.780
Karen: Speaking of avatars,

00:02:53.846 --> 00:02:55.382
could yours be any more sca‐‐

00:02:55.448 --> 00:02:58.085
‐ I mean s‐strong‐looking.
‐ [stifled laughter]

00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:01.254
‐ Hey! You were gonna say scary,
weren't you?!

00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:02.589
‐ Yeah. Sorry.

00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:04.724
But, like, it's true.

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:07.827
‐ Boss is the most intimidating
out of all of us.

00:03:07.894 --> 00:03:10.963
‐ Says you, Kana.
Look at how burly Sophie is.

00:03:11.031 --> 00:03:14.034
She's way scarier‐looking
than my avatar.

00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:17.137
‐ [laughs] I don't know.

00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:19.006
You're both pretty intimidating.

00:03:19.072 --> 00:03:21.741
‐ Since we're
making introductions,

00:03:21.808 --> 00:03:24.211
this is my avatar.
Her name's Toma.

00:03:24.277 --> 00:03:27.480
‐ Mi's from Russia, and one
of the coolest things about her

00:03:27.547 --> 00:03:28.981
is her real‐life skill.

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.784
Her dad taught her
how to drive a stick shift.

00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:33.820
Karen: So you're the one
who drove the truck.

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:36.856
‐ Whoo‐hoo! There she is!
This is my avatar.

00:03:36.923 --> 00:03:38.458
She's Roza!

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:41.328
‐ I never would have guessed
that was you, Shiori.

00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:42.462
‐ [giggles]

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:43.463
‐ [gasps]

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.899
Um, my avatar's called Anna.

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:49.602
Mm, I'm sorry
if I seem pretentious.

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.205
‐ Huh?
‐ Oh, Moe's always been weird

00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:54.007
about the avatar she got,
'cause she thinks

00:03:54.074 --> 00:03:56.143
she looks
like some stuck‐up celebrity.

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.811
We told her it's no big deal,
but still...

00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:01.148
‐ My turn! Check it out.

00:04:01.214 --> 00:04:03.316
Tanya's the girl
I get to play as.

00:04:03.383 --> 00:04:07.254
‐ Risa's the only one whose
avatar sort of looks like her.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.024
‐ That's it! Now you know which
avatar each one of us plays as.

00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:13.226
‐ Thanks. That helps a lot.

00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:16.329
Um, do you still want
to watch the rest of it?

00:04:16.396 --> 00:04:18.465
‐ Yeah, of course we do.
‐ Naturally!

00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:20.033
‐ We wouldn't miss it!
‐ Please. Please.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.234
‐ Heck, yeah, we're watching!

00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:23.470
‐ We wouldn't miss
this opportunity.

00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:24.671
The whole point of us

00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:26.306
coming here to watch
the footage with you

00:04:26.373 --> 00:04:28.741
is so you can explain
how you killed us all.

00:04:28.808 --> 00:04:30.643
That way,
we can take a bunch of notes

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.878
and learn from our mistakes

00:04:31.944 --> 00:04:34.447
so, the next time we play,
we can beat you.

00:04:34.514 --> 00:04:36.216
All: Please teach us your ways!

00:04:36.283 --> 00:04:37.450
‐ Uh...

00:04:37.517 --> 00:04:39.319
[chuckles]

00:04:44.424 --> 00:04:46.526
All: Mmm!

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:49.962
‐ Do you guys always have
your study sessions together?

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.965
‐ Doing stuff like this
helps us be a better team.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:54.634
‐ How?
‐ It's hard to believe now,

00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.904
but last year around April,
we didn't get along at all.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.139
‐ That is hard to believe.

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:01.708
‐ Back then,
we were totally hopeless.

00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:05.212
When we'd try to do a routine,
we'd be all out of sync.

00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:09.116
Do you know what
a full‐dive Sports Simulator is?

00:05:09.182 --> 00:05:10.750
‐ Mm‐mmm.

00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:12.385
‐ It's popular with athletes.

00:05:12.452 --> 00:05:14.854
With it, you can practice
your form and technique

00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:16.289
in any sport virtually.

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:17.790
You still need
real‐world strength

00:05:17.857 --> 00:05:19.292
to get anything
out of it, though.

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:22.562
‐ Is that why you were so nimble
during our last battle,

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.031
'cause you used that to train?

00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:25.365
‐ [giggles] A little.

00:05:25.432 --> 00:05:27.334
Like I said,
we didn't get along,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.702
and we were getting
on the coach's nerves.

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:30.903
‐ Boing!

00:05:31.804 --> 00:05:33.040
‐ Hey!

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:36.476
Sorry. Anyway, our coach
finally told us all,

00:05:36.543 --> 00:05:37.610
"Before I can do anything,

00:05:37.677 --> 00:05:40.313
you girls need to work
on becoming a team first,"

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.650
so we all talked
and came up with an idea.

00:05:43.716 --> 00:05:44.884
‐ Play a game together.

00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:47.687
‐ Exactly!
If we formed a party in a game,

00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:50.457
we'd naturally be forced
to work together to beat it.

00:05:50.523 --> 00:05:53.193
‐ And playing characters
in a virtual world made it easy

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.163
to forget the issues we had with
each other in the real world.

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:57.897
‐ Huh.

00:05:57.964 --> 00:06:00.367
[thinking]
In a way, we're a lot alike.

00:06:00.433 --> 00:06:03.003
Boss: Our world is nothing
like the one in G.G.O.,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.172
so when we heard about it,
we thought, "Yeah!

00:06:05.238 --> 00:06:07.907
Let's try this game where
we have to kill to survive."

00:06:07.974 --> 00:06:10.310
‐ So you started playing it,
and then‐‐

00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:12.679
Kana: Yup. We totally
got hooked on it.

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:14.247
‐ We still have
our disagreements.

00:06:14.314 --> 00:06:17.284
‐ But after so many battles
where we almost died...

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.351
[all giggle]

00:06:18.418 --> 00:06:20.787
‐ we get along
better than ever now!

00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:23.190
‐ I'm glad it all worked out.

00:06:24.091 --> 00:06:25.325
‐ We wanna keep getting better,

00:06:25.392 --> 00:06:27.427
and if they decide
to have another S.J.,

00:06:27.494 --> 00:06:29.696
our goal's to become
the number one team!

00:06:29.762 --> 00:06:31.731
‐ Uh, what about gymnastics?

00:06:31.798 --> 00:06:33.666
‐ Huh? Oh, sure.

00:06:33.733 --> 00:06:35.568
But we really
wanna win at G.G.O.

00:06:35.635 --> 00:06:36.936
So how about you?

00:06:37.004 --> 00:06:39.172
If they have another tourney,
are you gonna enter?

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:42.909
‐ Uh, not if
something important comes up.

00:06:42.975 --> 00:06:45.145
There's stuff
I wish I could do over,

00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:47.414
but I got
what I wanted out of it.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.950
Besides, teaming up with M
was a one‐time thing.

00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:53.153
‐ I don't know
how I feel about that.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.522
Part of me's happy,
and part of me's not.

00:06:55.588 --> 00:06:57.690
Without you there,
it'd be easier to win,

00:06:57.757 --> 00:07:00.760
but what sucks is
we won't get the challenge

00:07:00.827 --> 00:07:02.429
of fighting you again.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.565
Thanks for
having us over today.

00:07:05.632 --> 00:07:08.035
Girls: Thanks for
the tea and cookies, too!

00:07:08.101 --> 00:07:10.603
‐ Hope we didn't take up
too much of your time.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.206
‐ No, you didn't.
I'm on spring break.

00:07:13.273 --> 00:07:15.775
‐ You're so lucky!
You can full‐dive all you want.

00:07:15.842 --> 00:07:18.545
‐ Actually, I can't.
I'm going to visit my folks.

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:21.114
‐ Then while you're gone,
we'll be training

00:07:21.181 --> 00:07:23.283
and practicing tactics
and getting stronger.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.585
‐ [chuckles]
If they have another tourney,

00:07:25.652 --> 00:07:27.487
you'll have a good chance
at winning.

00:07:27.554 --> 00:07:30.190
[Boss groans]
It's really gonna suck

00:07:30.257 --> 00:07:32.459
if we don't get
to fight you again.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.897
Miyu: What's up, Kohi?!

00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:36.766
[laughs]
Welcome back to Hokkaido!

00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:39.935
Bet it's super cold
for a Tokyo girl like you.

00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:42.171
‐ Ooh! Love the hair!
‐ [camera snapping]

00:07:42.237 --> 00:07:43.305
You look cute!

00:07:43.372 --> 00:07:44.974
Did your folks
flip out about it?

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.242
I bet they did.
They did, didn't they?

00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:49.745
Gotta get the back. Oh, yeah!

00:07:49.812 --> 00:07:51.180
Okay, look over here!

00:07:51.246 --> 00:07:53.082
Hot. Very hot!

00:07:53.148 --> 00:07:55.417
Now, uh, lose the sweater.

00:07:55.484 --> 00:07:56.451
‐ [chuckles]

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.887
‐ I saw the video.

00:07:57.953 --> 00:07:59.955
S.J. looked like
it was a blast to play,

00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:03.125
and, oh, my gosh, you fought
like such a beast out there.

00:08:03.192 --> 00:08:05.494
No mercy. Like, I like it.

00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:08.163
So, girl, what's the deal
with you and M?

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.364
Why'd you split up?

00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:11.166
‐ [tape fast‐forwards]
‐ Interesting.

00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:14.136
Oh, well, as long as he doesn't
know your name and address,

00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:15.137
you're fine.

00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:16.171
‐ Yeah, I guess.

00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:18.073
I doubt we'll ever
meet in real life.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.210
‐ Hope not. Some hard‐core
gamers can be such weirdoes.

00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:23.345
Heck, I'm one of 'em,
so I should know!

00:08:23.412 --> 00:08:24.847
Speaking of, the other day,

00:08:24.914 --> 00:08:26.582
I got owned
by this Zekken person.

00:08:26.649 --> 00:08:27.917
They were so good,

00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:29.719
they must have spent
thousands of hours playing!

00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:31.687
I'm talkin' all day,
all night playing!

00:08:31.754 --> 00:08:33.222
Now that's not normal.

00:08:33.288 --> 00:08:34.924
‐ Oh, wow.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.927
‐ Ooh, they got more
Elza Kanzaki songs.

00:08:37.993 --> 00:08:39.128
‐ [gasps]

00:08:39.194 --> 00:08:41.631
‐ I wonder when
her next concert's gonna be.

00:08:41.697 --> 00:08:43.032
I heard she's taking a break.

00:08:43.098 --> 00:08:45.100
I think she's traveling
overseas or something.

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:48.771
Hopefully she'll be back soon,
but for now, let's rock.

‐ "ZASKAR is proud to announce

00:09:04.219 --> 00:09:06.822
that they will be hosting
a second Squad Jam.

00:09:07.723 --> 00:09:09.458
It will be held on Saturday,

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:11.026
April 4, at 1 PM.

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:13.596
Also, the sponsor
for this event

00:09:13.663 --> 00:09:15.464
wishes to remain anonymous.

00:09:15.531 --> 00:09:17.867
Please refer
to the player's guide,

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:20.269
as some of the rules
have changed.

00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:22.638
Register by noon, April 1.

00:09:22.705 --> 00:09:25.340
If there are
30 or more teams participating,

00:09:25.407 --> 00:09:26.609
preliminaries will be held

00:09:26.676 --> 00:09:28.878
the day
before the event at 8 PM.

Teams with a leader
from one of the top four teams

00:09:31.246 --> 00:09:35.017
in the previous S.J.
are exempt from the prelims."

[sighs]

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:37.953
Eh?

00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:39.889
Saki?

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:41.456
Saki: Did you get the email?!

00:09:41.524 --> 00:09:42.825
They're having S.J. 2!

00:09:42.892 --> 00:09:44.594
Participating,
all of us are!

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.128
Yes, that was an anastrophe.

00:09:46.195 --> 00:09:48.330
Anyway, we've been
training hard for this!

00:09:48.397 --> 00:09:50.032
It's almost spring break
for us, too,

00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:51.834
so we finished all our exams!

00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:54.169
I know it's a long shot,
but if you change your mind

00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:56.706
and decide to sign up for this,
you'd make us so happy!

00:09:56.772 --> 00:09:58.040
I want to see LLENN again!

00:09:58.107 --> 00:10:00.142
I want to fight her!
I want to shoot her!

00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:02.444
I want to have
a duel to the death with her!

00:10:02.512 --> 00:10:05.280
I also want to come over
for tea and cookies again,

00:10:05.347 --> 00:10:06.716
if that's cool.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.052
‐ I think I'll sit this one out.

00:10:19.562 --> 00:10:21.864
‐ Are you Karen Kohiruimaki?

00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:24.166
‐ Uh, yes, that's me.

00:10:24.233 --> 00:10:25.935
What do‐‐

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:28.103
‐ [screams]
‐ Whoa!

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.606
Easy, LLENN! Don't scream.
It's me, M.

00:10:30.673 --> 00:10:32.307
‐ [stammers]

00:10:32.374 --> 00:10:33.576
You're kidding.

00:10:33.643 --> 00:10:35.177
You're M? I don't believe it.

00:10:35.244 --> 00:10:37.179
‐ But I really am M.

00:10:37.246 --> 00:10:41.617
‐ O‐Okay, let's just say
you are M for now.

00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:44.854
How'd you know I'm LLENN,
and how'd you find me?

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.421
‐ I'll explain later.

00:10:46.488 --> 00:10:47.890
I had to talk to you,

00:10:47.957 --> 00:10:49.592
'cause something
important's come up.

00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:51.126
We shouldn't be seen together.

00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:53.028
Is there
someplace quiet we can go

00:10:53.095 --> 00:10:55.364
where we can, you know,
sit down and talk?

00:10:56.599 --> 00:10:58.133
‐ And what'll happen
if I say no?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.704
‐ If you do, on the night
of the next Squad Jam,

00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:04.273
someone will die.

00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:06.911
M: There.

00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:08.112
‐ Thanks.

00:11:10.714 --> 00:11:12.917
Are you really M from the game?

00:11:12.984 --> 00:11:15.086
‐ Yup.
‐ Can you prove it?

00:11:15.152 --> 00:11:16.553
‐ No, I can't.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.322
‐ [creak]
‐ Mm.

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:20.491
Why should I believe
anything you say, then?

00:11:20.557 --> 00:11:23.627
‐ Look, I'm not lying.
I wish I had proof, but I don't.

00:11:23.694 --> 00:11:26.864
‐ You could tell me something
only M and I would know.

00:11:26.931 --> 00:11:28.599
‐ Even if I did,
what's to stop you

00:11:28.665 --> 00:11:31.035
from thinking I heard it
from the "real" M?

00:11:31.102 --> 00:11:33.304
See, there's that. I'm sorry,

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.873
but you just have to trust
that I'm telling the truth.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.941
‐ That's so not fair.

00:11:37.008 --> 00:11:38.509
‐ No, it's not.

00:11:38.575 --> 00:11:41.745
‐ You still haven't
answered my first question.

00:11:41.813 --> 00:11:44.748
How'd you know I was LLENN,
and where'd you get my address?

00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:48.085
‐ I'll tell you, but you
have to hear me out first.

00:11:48.152 --> 00:11:49.786
I'm sorry.
It has to be that way.

00:11:49.854 --> 00:11:51.288
‐ Go ahead.

00:11:51.355 --> 00:11:53.524
Tell me whatever it is
that's so important.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.627
But before you start, can you
at least tell me your name?

00:11:56.693 --> 00:11:59.463
‐ Oh, yeah, right.
It's Goushi Asougi.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.866
I'm sorry I didn't
introduce myself before.

00:12:01.933 --> 00:12:04.869
‐ All right, Goushi.
Let's hear what you wanna say.

00:12:04.936 --> 00:12:07.038
‐ Please, Karen!
‐ [gasps]

00:12:07.104 --> 00:12:08.906
‐ Don't talk. Just listen.

00:12:08.973 --> 00:12:10.174
There's something I need,

00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:12.309
and you're the only one
I can turn to.

00:12:12.376 --> 00:12:15.079
‐ Oh, my gosh.
Is he hitting on me?

00:12:15.146 --> 00:12:17.448
‐ I'm sorry to have
to dump this on you,

00:12:17.514 --> 00:12:20.051
but if you don't help,
two people will die.

00:12:20.117 --> 00:12:21.052
‐ Pardon?

00:12:21.118 --> 00:12:22.854
‐ Two people will die,

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.422
me and the real Pitohui.

00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:27.191
‐ Say what?

00:12:27.258 --> 00:12:29.293
Does this have anything to do

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.029
with what you told me
back in S.J. about Pito?

00:12:32.096 --> 00:12:34.832
‐ It does,
and I meant every word of it.

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:37.568
Pito really is crazy.

00:12:37.634 --> 00:12:40.104
‐ You're not gonna cry again,
are you?

00:12:40.171 --> 00:12:42.473
‐ Pito's signing up for S.J. 2.

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:45.176
She's forcing me
to put a team together.

00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:47.644
‐ With you and Pito
on the same team,

00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:49.814
you guys have
a good shot at winning.

00:12:49.881 --> 00:12:52.850
‐ And she'll be playing to win,
that's for sure.

00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:54.218
But like everything with her,

00:12:54.285 --> 00:12:55.987
the stakes are
what matters most.

00:12:56.053 --> 00:12:58.489
She told me
that if she didn't win,

00:12:58.555 --> 00:13:00.757
she was going to commit suicide,

00:13:00.825 --> 00:13:03.460
not in the game, for real.

00:13:03.527 --> 00:13:05.229
‐ [stammers]

00:13:05.296 --> 00:13:07.331
‐ She said I have to die, too,

00:13:07.398 --> 00:13:10.167
and that if I didn't
kill myself, she'd kill me.

00:13:10.234 --> 00:13:12.103
When she says
she's gonna do something,

00:13:12.169 --> 00:13:13.838
she does it,
and there's no stopping her.

00:13:13.905 --> 00:13:17.809
‐ So you're pretty much
in the same situation as before.

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.543
‐ Yeah.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.245
‐ [moans]

00:13:21.312 --> 00:13:22.646
This is nuts.

00:13:22.713 --> 00:13:25.682
Why is Pito forcing you
to do weird stuff like this?

00:13:25.749 --> 00:13:26.884
It's just a game.

00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:29.020
You shouldn't have to die
for real if you lose.

00:13:29.086 --> 00:13:32.523
‐ She's been obsessed with death
for as long as I've known her.

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:35.292
She's always looking
to put herself in situations

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:37.561
‐ where her life is on the line.
‐ Why is that?

00:13:37.628 --> 00:13:40.764
‐ It goes all the way back
to "Sword Art Online."

00:13:40.832 --> 00:13:43.968
Try to imagine what it was like
being trapped in it.

00:13:44.035 --> 00:13:46.938
You can't log out,
knowing that if you died there,

00:13:47.004 --> 00:13:48.940
you'd also die
in the real world.

00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:52.643
‐ Wait. Are you telling me Pito
is one of the S.A.O. survivors?

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:56.347
‐ Uh‐uh. I mean, technically
she played it and didn't die,

00:13:56.413 --> 00:13:58.782
but she's not an S.A.O. survivor.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.017
She's the opposite.

00:14:00.084 --> 00:14:01.485
‐ What do you mean?

00:14:01.552 --> 00:14:04.621
‐ In a twisted way,
she's more like an S.A.O....

00:14:04.688 --> 00:14:06.257
failure, or loser.

00:14:06.323 --> 00:14:07.992
‐ An S.A.O. loser?

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:11.795
‐ The real Pito played S.A.O.
during the beta‐testing phase.

00:14:11.863 --> 00:14:14.832
She played it all the time,
day in, day out.

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:17.935
She was even looking forward
to playing the official release

00:14:18.002 --> 00:14:19.536
the day it went public.

00:14:19.603 --> 00:14:21.372
‐ But she didn't get to.

00:14:21.438 --> 00:14:22.874
‐ No, she didn't.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.877
That day, she had something
she couldn't get out of,

00:14:25.943 --> 00:14:28.813
something life‐changing,
an amazing opportunity,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.817
and she couldn't pass it up.
She cried her eyes out,

00:14:32.884 --> 00:14:36.553
and then she made the decision
that set her life's course.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.822
Thank God.

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:39.390
‐ She made the right choice.

00:14:39.456 --> 00:14:41.993
She didn't get trapped
in S.A.O. with the others.

00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:43.327
Talk about lucky.

00:14:43.394 --> 00:14:45.562
‐ That's what a normal person
would think,

00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:47.698
but Pito's not normal.

00:14:47.764 --> 00:14:50.534
When she found out
S.A.O. was a game

00:14:50.601 --> 00:14:54.238
where the life‐or‐death stakes
were real, she snapped.

00:14:54.305 --> 00:14:56.407
She cursed herself
for missing out on it,

00:14:56.473 --> 00:15:00.444
and she screamed, wailed,
sobbed, became violent.

00:15:00.511 --> 00:15:02.914
Death was her obsession,

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.250
and the chance to experience it
had escaped her.

00:15:07.284 --> 00:15:09.053
Pito raged for a long time,

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.822
but she eventually cooled off.

00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:13.757
She started putting
all her energy into her work,

00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:16.793
and, as a result,
she became very successful.

00:15:16.861 --> 00:15:19.696
‐ So she's the president
of a company or something?

00:15:19.763 --> 00:15:22.666
‐ Yeah, you can say that.
Anyway, ever since the newer,

00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:24.802
safer VR games
landed on the market,

00:15:24.869 --> 00:15:27.338
she's been spending
all her free time playing,

00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:30.942
although they don't
seem to satisfy her.

00:15:31.008 --> 00:15:33.410
Games that don't have
real life‐or‐death stakes

00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:35.579
aren't enough
to get her pulse racing.

00:15:35.646 --> 00:15:37.714
‐ It doesn't need to be racing.

00:15:37.781 --> 00:15:39.483
Normal games
are intense enough.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.085
You don't have to die.

00:15:41.152 --> 00:15:42.854
‐ And then about two years

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.256
after Pito started
that new career of hers,

00:15:45.322 --> 00:15:47.191
the S.A.O. Incident was over.

00:15:47.258 --> 00:15:49.293
When she heard the stories
the survivors told

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.528
about the nightmare
they just lived through,

00:15:51.595 --> 00:15:53.664
it set her off again,
but even worse.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.033
‐ [gasps]
‐ She heard about these players

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.070
who roamed the game
killing others in cold blood.

00:15:59.136 --> 00:16:02.206
They were in a guild that
specialized in assassination.

00:16:02.273 --> 00:16:04.441
‐ What?!
I thought that was a rumor.

00:16:04.508 --> 00:16:06.043
‐ It wasn't.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.778
According to the survivors,

00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:10.281
killing was this group's
reason for living,

00:16:10.347 --> 00:16:12.683
and they slaughtered
countless innocent people.

00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:15.119
In the end,
a group of players got together

00:16:15.186 --> 00:16:16.520
and hunted them down,

00:16:16.587 --> 00:16:19.023
killing most of them
and locking up the rest.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.792
‐ That sounds like a nightmare.

00:16:21.859 --> 00:16:24.261
‐ I thought so, too,
but Pito didn't.

00:16:24.328 --> 00:16:26.931
In her mind, it was
the perfect opportunity.

00:16:26.998 --> 00:16:28.432
If she'd been in S.A.O.,

00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:30.301
she could have been
an assassin like them

00:16:30.367 --> 00:16:31.903
or the one
that brought them down.

00:16:31.969 --> 00:16:34.138
For her, it was
all about the killing.

00:16:34.205 --> 00:16:35.672
It didn't matter who or why.

00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:39.143
She missed her chance to kill,
and that frustrated her.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.777
‐ That's crazy.

00:16:40.845 --> 00:16:43.514
‐ I know.
That's what I've been saying.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.583
She's even more obsessed
with that goddamn S.A.O. now

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.152
than she ever was before.

00:16:48.219 --> 00:16:50.354
I mean, for the past few months,

00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:52.423
she seemed to be
doing all right.

00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:55.960
Playing G.G.O. was letting her
blow off some steam.

00:16:56.027 --> 00:16:58.329
But when she
couldn't participate in S.J.,

00:16:58.395 --> 00:17:00.431
it caused her
to relapse something awful.

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:03.467
Pito: I know
what you're thinking,

00:17:03.534 --> 00:17:05.837
how'd I know?
It's simple, really.

00:17:07.238 --> 00:17:09.040
I'm here for the same reason.

00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:11.809
There's all kinds of stuff
in my real life that I hate

00:17:11.876 --> 00:17:15.246
or can't do anything about,
but here in G.G.O.,

00:17:15.312 --> 00:17:17.982
I get to unload
on monsters and people

00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:20.551
and kill the hell out of them
with no regrets.

00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:25.322
‐ So the reason Pito
wants to gamble her life

00:17:25.389 --> 00:17:27.724
is to turn S.J. 2
into another death game,

00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:29.593
and all because
she wants to experience

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.028
what being in one's like?

00:17:31.095 --> 00:17:32.029
‐ That's right.

00:17:32.096 --> 00:17:33.697
‐ But what can I do? I mean,

00:17:33.764 --> 00:17:36.600
shouldn't you tell, like,
the police or a psychiatrist?

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:39.503
‐ I can't.
If this is what she wants,

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.005
I have to go along with it.

00:17:41.072 --> 00:17:44.942
‐ But why? Is it because
you respect her intentions?

00:17:45.009 --> 00:17:45.943
‐ Yeah.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.245
‐ Even if it means
doing something crazy

00:17:48.312 --> 00:17:50.381
or, worse, suicidal?

00:17:50.447 --> 00:17:52.683
‐ Yes.
‐ Uh...

00:17:52.749 --> 00:17:55.519
sorry. I don't understand
any of this.

00:17:56.553 --> 00:17:57.855
[can clatters]

00:17:57.922 --> 00:18:00.657
Unbelievable.
I know Pito's messed up,

00:18:00.724 --> 00:18:02.927
but this guy's
off his rocker, too.

00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:04.862
[sighs]

00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:09.266
Uh...

00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:12.336
[slam echoes]

00:18:12.403 --> 00:18:13.504
[gasps]

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.472
The infamous wall slam.

00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:18.109
Oh, my gosh.
Is he gonna try and kiss me?

00:18:18.175 --> 00:18:19.844
‐ Have you ever loved someone?

00:18:19.911 --> 00:18:22.179
I'm talking
seriously loved someone.

00:18:22.246 --> 00:18:23.614
Were you ever in a relationship

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.616
where you'd do anything
for the other person,

00:18:25.682 --> 00:18:27.584
you'd even give
your life for them?

00:18:27.651 --> 00:18:29.653
‐ N‐No, I haven't.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.890
‐ Then you have absolutely
no idea how I feel right now!

00:18:32.957 --> 00:18:37.328
‐ So, then, like, you're saying
you have a major crush on Pito.

00:18:37.394 --> 00:18:38.729
‐ I love her!

00:18:38.795 --> 00:18:41.532
‐ Here's my first
wall slam moment,

00:18:41.598 --> 00:18:44.335
and the guy confesses his love
for someone else.

00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:46.737
Life sure is unpredictable.

00:18:46.804 --> 00:18:48.772
Why don't you have a seat,

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.276
and I'll go get us
some more drinks? My treat.

00:18:52.343 --> 00:18:54.511
Sugar‐free, right?

00:18:54.578 --> 00:18:56.747
‐ Yeah. Thank you.

00:18:56.814 --> 00:18:59.783
You know,
I don't really like coffee,

00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:02.753
especially black.
Makes my stomach churn.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.855
‐ Oh.

00:19:03.921 --> 00:19:06.690
‐ Pito, on the other hand,
really loves coffee,

00:19:06.757 --> 00:19:10.194
especially black,
so I drink it, too.

00:19:12.897 --> 00:19:14.431
[groans]

00:19:14.498 --> 00:19:16.200
‐ Love's scary.

00:19:16.267 --> 00:19:18.569
Back when we were playing S.J.,

00:19:18.635 --> 00:19:21.172
you were terrified you were
gonna die in real life.

00:19:21.238 --> 00:19:24.441
It's a little strange you
don't seem scared about it now.

00:19:24.508 --> 00:19:26.010
‐ It's not that strange.

00:19:26.077 --> 00:19:28.880
As long as Pito dies first,
I'd happily follow.

00:19:28.946 --> 00:19:30.815
The only thing
that ever scared me

00:19:30.882 --> 00:19:33.484
is if I died first
and left Pito behind.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.619
‐ They're perfect
for each other.

00:19:35.686 --> 00:19:37.621
They're both weird.

00:19:37.688 --> 00:19:38.622
[tape fast‐forwards]

00:19:38.689 --> 00:19:40.557
So a few minutes ago,

00:19:40.624 --> 00:19:43.294
you said I was the only one
who could help Pito.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.529
‐ Yes, and I still think so.

00:19:45.596 --> 00:19:47.531
The question is,
are you up for it?

00:19:47.598 --> 00:19:49.333
‐ How? I don't know
where to start.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.468
‐ Just sign up for S.J. 2,
and beat her!

00:19:51.535 --> 00:19:53.037
That's all you have to do!

00:19:54.005 --> 00:19:56.440
‐ Huh?!
You want me to beat her?!

00:19:56.507 --> 00:19:58.910
‐ Yes. Hunt her down,
and kill her.

00:19:58.976 --> 00:20:01.946
If you do, I guarantee
she won't commit suicide,

00:20:02.013 --> 00:20:03.815
and she won't kill me, either.

00:20:03.881 --> 00:20:06.918
‐ But you said if she died,
she'd kill herself!

00:20:06.984 --> 00:20:09.553
‐ I know. And I know
you think I'm crazy.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.156
I am crazy,
but you have to trust me.

00:20:12.223 --> 00:20:13.524
This will work.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.493
Sign up for S.J. 2,
and beat her, please.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.864
It won't be easy, though,
'cause we will be fighting back.

00:20:19.931 --> 00:20:23.600
‐ But can't you, like, wound her
or set her up or something

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:25.402
so I have a better shot
at taking her out?

00:20:25.469 --> 00:20:29.006
‐ No way. It has to be
a straight‐up head‐to‐head duel!

00:20:29.073 --> 00:20:32.944
Anything else would be cheating,
and besides, you promised!

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.745
‐ Yeah, we did.

00:20:34.812 --> 00:20:38.015
‐ How about one of these days,
we have ourselves a duel?

00:20:38.082 --> 00:20:40.484
And if you can beat me,
you get to pick where we meet.

00:20:40.551 --> 00:20:42.719
Train your butt off
'til you think you're ready.

00:20:42.786 --> 00:20:44.889
Then, if you can blow
my head off with P‐chan,

00:20:44.956 --> 00:20:46.557
we can meet up
anywhere you want.

00:20:46.623 --> 00:20:48.592
It's a promise between women.

00:20:48.659 --> 00:20:50.461
[guns clang]

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.698
All right.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.204
I'll do it.
I'll sign up. I'll fight.

00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:05.910
I don't know how,
but I'll beat her.

00:22:40.404 --> 00:22:43.875
Goushi: If anything comes up,
feel free to contact me here.

00:22:43.941 --> 00:22:47.044
‐ Who the heck am I gonna get
to be on my team?

00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:49.080
It has to be someone I trust,

00:22:49.146 --> 00:22:51.215
and they have to be
a good player, too,

00:22:51.282 --> 00:22:54.218
but I don't know
anybody else in G.G.O.

00:22:54.285 --> 00:22:56.854
I'm an introvert.
LLENN's an introvert.

00:22:56.921 --> 00:22:58.755
[groans] I'm so screwed.

00:22:58.823 --> 00:23:00.424
Ugh. What do I do?

who's a CEO of something
in real life.

She's kinda crazy,
and to save her,

00:23:11.768 --> 00:23:13.537
I need you to help me kill her.

00:23:13.604 --> 00:23:14.872
What do you say?

00:23:14.939 --> 00:23:16.673
You're the only one
I can count on.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.709
Help me, please!

I should take it easy, though.

If I get too hype, I might
kill this Pitohui myself,
