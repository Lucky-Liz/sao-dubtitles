WEBVTT

00:00:02.173 --> 00:00:04.309
[heart beating]

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:13.451
‐ [gasps]

00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:24.262
[LLENN yells]

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:34.973
‐ Crap! She's so small!

00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:43.248
‐ Little runt!

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:46.852
[gasps, groans]

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:54.459
Aw, come on!

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.401
LLENN: Hey, M,
you see the others?

00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:04.936
M: [radio] Nope.

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.672
I guess they decided
to call it a day and resigned.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.040
‐ [gasps]

00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:12.010
Then, does that mean
we beat them?

00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:13.979
Like, we did it?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.183
‐ That's right. Nice job.

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:20.385
‐ [muffled squealing]

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.058
Whoo‐hoo!

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:31.096
[players gasping, murmuring]

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:33.098
‐ You see how fast she is?

00:01:33.164 --> 00:01:36.201
They had her pinned,
and she still wasted all of 'em.

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:38.503
‐ That's the Pink Devil
for you. Damn.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.539
‐ Bitch move, using that dude's
corpse for a shield.

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:42.941
‐ She wasn't breaking any rules,

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.811
so don't call her a bitch,
you dick.

00:01:45.877 --> 00:01:48.947
‐ There's only
three teams left now.

00:03:21.174 --> 00:03:24.011
LLENN: That was amazing!
I still can't believe it!

00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:25.178
How'd you do that?

00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:26.847
‐ How'd I do what?

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:29.049
‐ How'd you know
the best way to get us here?

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:31.218
We didn't get lost
or turned around.

00:03:31.284 --> 00:03:34.454
‐ It's just a real‐life skill
I brought with me to the game.

00:03:34.521 --> 00:03:35.889
I always had
a good sense of direction,

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:38.558
‐ ever since I was a kid.
‐ Really?

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:41.729
‐ I've never gotten lost,
in games or real life.

00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:44.664
I can look at any map,
and I can memorize it.

00:03:44.732 --> 00:03:47.034
I can even guess
what the terrain'll be like.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.335
‐ Oh! Now I get it!

00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:50.037
That's how you got your handle!

00:03:50.103 --> 00:03:53.140
"M" stands for map
or mapper or map‐pro, right?

00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:56.276
‐ Uh, well...

00:03:56.343 --> 00:03:57.510
yeah. You're right.

00:03:57.577 --> 00:03:58.979
‐ That's so cool!

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:01.548
Your name
totally makes sense now.

00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:03.083
‐ Time for the scan.

00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:10.991
‐ You see that? There's only
three teams left in the game.

00:04:11.058 --> 00:04:13.861
That's perfect!
We're guaranteed a bronze medal!

00:04:13.927 --> 00:04:16.696
‐ When Pito said win,
she meant the whole tourney.

00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:18.698
‐ Being third's not so bad.

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:21.668
‐ Please try to focus.
Check out the desert.

00:04:21.735 --> 00:04:23.636
There's one team
five klicks away.

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:26.406
‐ That other one's closer.

00:04:26.473 --> 00:04:28.275
‐ They're in the middle
of a marsh,

00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:29.542
and that's a problem.

00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:31.378
We'd never reach them
in ten minutes,

00:04:31.444 --> 00:04:33.580
when the next scan happens.

00:04:33.646 --> 00:04:36.283
It's been one hour
since we started.

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.450
‐ What'd you say?

00:04:37.517 --> 00:04:39.619
‐ Nothing.
Let's head for the lake

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:42.222
and find a place to set a trap.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.157
‐ Roger that, M!

00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:47.194
[humming a tune]

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.809
[thinking]
We'll come in third, at least,

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:05.078
and if we can ambush
the others, we might even win.

00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:06.179
‐ M: Enemy!
‐ [gasps]

00:05:06.246 --> 00:05:07.580
‐ They're on your right.

00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:09.516
‐ Down!
‐ [gasps]

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.762
But it hasn't
even been five minutes.

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:24.164
How'd they get to us
so fast, M?!

00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:26.734
‐ They got their hands
on some vehicles.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.435
‐ What, like a boat?

00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:30.270
[engines roaring]

00:05:51.358 --> 00:05:52.625
Holy smokes!

00:05:52.692 --> 00:05:55.128
‐ They're gonna fire! Roll left!

00:06:04.938 --> 00:06:06.206
[groans]

00:06:07.307 --> 00:06:08.241
You okay, M?

00:06:08.308 --> 00:06:09.743
‐ Yeah.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.779
‐ What do we do? Retreat?

00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:13.914
‐ No. They'd just
chase after us.

00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:16.016
‐ With what?
They're all driving boats!

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:18.018
‐ No, they're hovercrafts.

00:06:18.085 --> 00:06:20.020
They can run
on flat terrain, too.

00:06:20.087 --> 00:06:22.489
They can drive on up
and run us down.

00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:23.791
‐ That's so not fair!

00:06:23.857 --> 00:06:25.692
‐ These guys are good.

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.227
They know they got us trapped,

00:06:27.294 --> 00:06:28.996
and they probably
figured out by now

00:06:29.062 --> 00:06:30.964
there's just
the two of us out here.

00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:33.600
‐ How 'bout this?
I could run around

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:35.936
and draw their fire
while you get away.

00:06:36.003 --> 00:06:37.537
‐ Now that's a good idea.

00:06:37.604 --> 00:06:40.841
But instead of running,
I'll just shoot from here.

00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:42.776
‐ What are you doing?

00:06:42.843 --> 00:06:43.977
Are you giving up?

00:06:44.044 --> 00:06:45.078
‐ Hell, no.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:46.079
‐ Eh?

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.816
I'm unpacking this.

00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:50.884
‐ You pack a cannon
or something?!

00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:52.953
‐ Nope.
‐ Eh?

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.259
‐ [grunts]

00:07:03.864 --> 00:07:06.166
‐ What in the heck
is that thing?!

00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:10.270
‐ I'm just a big chicken.
This is my armored chicken coop.

00:07:10.337 --> 00:07:11.772
‐ More like chicken tank!

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.340
‐ They're back.

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:14.742
‐ [gasps]

00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:23.083
‐ Come on, you suckers.
I'm ready for you.

00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:26.519
‐ [chuckles]

00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:28.421
‐ Watch out, M!

00:07:35.128 --> 00:07:36.329
What do I do?!

00:07:36.396 --> 00:07:37.364
‐ Unload on 'em!

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.665
Don't worry about aiming!

00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:41.101
‐ 'Kay. If you say so.

00:07:45.005 --> 00:07:46.639
I was worried there
for a second, M.

00:07:46.707 --> 00:07:48.141
That shield's awesome.

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:51.578
‐ It can deflect any bullet
up to 7.62 caliber,

00:07:51.644 --> 00:07:53.013
even at point‐blank range.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.447
‐ That's even more awesome!

00:07:54.514 --> 00:07:57.617
‐ It's special plating.
According to G.G.O. lore,

00:07:57.684 --> 00:07:59.286
it's from a space battleship.

00:07:59.352 --> 00:08:01.955
It's the strongest stuff
you can get in the game.

00:08:02.022 --> 00:08:04.491
The black market's the only
place where you can buy it,

00:08:04.557 --> 00:08:06.193
and it costs an arm and a leg.

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:09.029
They know how tough this is now.
When they come back,

00:08:09.096 --> 00:08:11.331
they're gonna hit me
with everything they got.

00:08:11.398 --> 00:08:12.332
‐ Oh, great.

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.901
‐ Here's what you do.

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:16.904
Take off at full speed,
and run a zigzag pattern.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.772
When their Bullet Lines pop up,

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.874
do whatever you can
to evade their fire.

00:08:20.941 --> 00:08:22.675
‐ Are you gonna try
to snipe them?

00:08:22.743 --> 00:08:23.811
‐ Yup.

00:08:23.877 --> 00:08:25.212
‐ But if they see
your Bullet Line,

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:27.247
won't they just try
to evade it, too?

00:08:27.314 --> 00:08:28.248
‐ That's right.

00:08:28.315 --> 00:08:29.717
‐ But then what?

00:08:29.783 --> 00:08:31.451
‐ We'll talk later.

00:08:32.685 --> 00:08:34.021
Leader: Get ready to attack.

00:08:34.087 --> 00:08:36.189
I wanna kill those two
by the next scan.

00:08:36.256 --> 00:08:38.658
Focus on the guy
with the shield.

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:40.160
Watch out for his Bullet Lines.

00:08:40.227 --> 00:08:43.330
Jake, keep right,
and give us cover fire.

00:08:43.396 --> 00:08:44.564
Team: Roger that!

00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:46.066
‐ Let's get to work!

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.842
We're at 200 meters.

00:08:54.908 --> 00:08:56.877
Light 'em up!

00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:58.678
‐ [gasps]

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.047
M: Get going!

00:09:00.113 --> 00:09:02.615
‐ I am! Jeez! Here goes nothing!

00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:05.252
Oh, my gosh! Whoa!

00:09:09.923 --> 00:09:13.794
‐ [deep breath]

00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:15.462
‐ [gunshot]
‐ [gags]

00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:19.266
‐ What the hell?!

00:09:21.034 --> 00:09:22.669
I didn't see...

00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:24.637
no line.

00:09:24.705 --> 00:09:26.539
‐ That's two of 'em down.

00:09:26.606 --> 00:09:27.607
‐ You got 'em!

00:09:27.674 --> 00:09:29.209
‐ They got Jake and Lax!

00:09:29.276 --> 00:09:31.178
‐ Stay sharp!
Watch for their lines!

00:09:31.244 --> 00:09:33.513
‐ [deep breath]

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.282
‐ [gunshot]
‐ [gags]

00:09:36.917 --> 00:09:38.385
‐ I don't believe it.

00:09:38.451 --> 00:09:39.753
[gunshot]

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.722
‐ [whimpers]

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:43.857
‐ Only one more to go.

00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:46.827
Incoming!

00:09:46.894 --> 00:09:48.061
M: Get down!

00:09:49.362 --> 00:09:50.463
[grunts]

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.432
LLENN: A plasma grenade!

00:09:53.734 --> 00:09:55.468
‐ Oh, no! You missed!

00:10:01.508 --> 00:10:02.976
[gasps]

00:10:08.615 --> 00:10:10.483
‐ Finish him off! Hurry!

00:10:14.587 --> 00:10:16.023
‐ Huh?

00:10:18.658 --> 00:10:20.160
‐ Sorry.

00:10:30.804 --> 00:10:32.472
[gasps]

00:10:32.539 --> 00:10:35.275
[panting]

00:10:36.343 --> 00:10:39.780
[waves lapping]

00:10:39.847 --> 00:10:43.316
‐ Rest in peace,
whoever you are.

00:10:44.484 --> 00:10:47.687
Did you see that, M?!
I got him good!

00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:49.656
‐ Yeah. I'll say you did.

00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:52.926
‐ I can't believe
what an amazing shot you are!

00:10:52.993 --> 00:10:55.929
I mean, you didn't waste
a single bullet!

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.067
But don't you think
it's kind of weird

00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:01.668
they didn't dodge
your Bullet Lines?

00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:03.937
‐ They didn't,
'cause they couldn't see 'em.

00:11:04.004 --> 00:11:06.573
‐ What are you talking about?
They had to have.

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:07.775
It's supposed to show up

00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:10.043
when you put your finger
on the trigger.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.713
I only touched the trigger
when I fired.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.815
‐ Then what about
your Bullet Circle?

00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:16.416
‐ I never even saw it.

00:11:16.483 --> 00:11:19.552
‐ But then,
how did you aim without it?

00:11:21.822 --> 00:11:23.891
‐ Directly.

00:11:23.957 --> 00:11:25.658
‐ Huh?

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.164
Pito: G.G.O. is
a game in the end,

00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:30.265
so it needs to be fun.

00:11:30.332 --> 00:11:32.668
Certain things are rigged
to be a lot easier

00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:35.337
to do here than in real life.
Like shooting.

00:11:35.405 --> 00:11:37.106
LLENN: I'm not sure I get it.

00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:39.675
‐ I guess the easiest way
to explain is,

00:11:39.742 --> 00:11:42.311
say the you in the real world
had a real P90.

00:11:42.377 --> 00:11:45.347
Do you think you could hit
a real target from 100 meters

00:11:45.415 --> 00:11:46.916
as easy as you can in G.G.O.?

00:11:46.982 --> 00:11:50.152
‐ I guess not?
I don't know. Maybe?

00:11:50.219 --> 00:11:54.023
‐ Nope. In the real world,
there's no system assist.

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:54.890
‐ Sorry, a what?

00:11:54.957 --> 00:11:56.526
‐ It's called system assist.

00:11:56.592 --> 00:11:59.294
As long as your target's in your
Bullet Circle when you fire,

00:11:59.361 --> 00:12:00.463
the game pretty much guarantees

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.832
you'll score a hit
on it somewhere.

00:12:04.534 --> 00:12:08.037
You think it's your skill,
but it's the game helping you.

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:09.204
‐ I see.

00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:11.674
‐ The assist gets better
the more you level up,

00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:15.277
and the higher your level gets,
the better the gun you can get,

00:12:15.344 --> 00:12:16.612
which makes you more accurate.

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:18.814
Everything gets easier,

00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:20.850
so the player can get
stronger and stronger.

00:12:20.916 --> 00:12:23.786
‐ Or faster and faster,
in my case.

00:12:23.853 --> 00:12:25.154
‐ I did a test once

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.690
where I had my target centered
in my Bullet Circle.

00:12:27.757 --> 00:12:29.058
I had it lined up perfect,

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.193
then pulled the trigger hard,
so my rifle jerked.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.730
It was sloppy, but where do
you think that bullet ended up?

00:12:34.797 --> 00:12:37.199
‐ In the circle?
'Cause the assist?

00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:40.703
‐ Not just in the circle.
It hit the target dead center.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.573
That made me see
the trigger on a gun's

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:45.441
like the button
on a controller.

00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:48.444
‐ I wonder what would happen

00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:50.212
if G.G.O. got rid of the assist,

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:52.715
you know, to make shooting
exactly like real life.

00:12:52.782 --> 00:12:54.984
‐ Trying to hit a target
from 100 meters

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.252
with an assault rifle
would be impossible.

00:12:57.319 --> 00:13:00.690
Without the assist, this would
be the crappiest game ever.

00:13:00.756 --> 00:13:02.625
‐ And no one would play it.

00:13:02.692 --> 00:13:04.927
‐ Yup. It's a game, after all.

00:13:04.994 --> 00:13:06.996
If it were
a straight‐up simulator,

00:13:07.062 --> 00:13:08.564
it wouldn't be any fun.

00:13:08.631 --> 00:13:10.900
G.G.O. works fine as is.

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:12.402
‐ I have a question, ma'am!

00:13:12.468 --> 00:13:16.238
What if a good shooter
in real life played this?

00:13:16.305 --> 00:13:18.173
Would they be
just as good in the game?

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.644
‐ I wondered the same thing,
so I asked someone I knew

00:13:21.711 --> 00:13:24.213
with real‐world
shooting experience to play.

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:25.415
‐ How'd they do?

00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:28.451
‐ Eh, it was a little confusing
for him at first,

00:13:28.518 --> 00:13:30.219
but after he got used to it‐‐

00:13:30.285 --> 00:13:32.688
heh‐‐he was
hitting targets like a boss.

00:13:32.755 --> 00:13:34.657
‐ Oh.

00:13:34.724 --> 00:13:36.526
‐ After he got done
playing the game,

00:13:36.592 --> 00:13:38.260
he said something interesting.

00:13:38.327 --> 00:13:41.797
He said the Bullet Circle had
a positive and a negative side.

00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:43.298
‐ Negative, how?

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.669
‐ The assist lets you hit
a target without really trying,

00:13:46.736 --> 00:13:48.270
so the practice
you get shooting here

00:13:48.337 --> 00:13:50.272
isn't the same
as what you get in reality.

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:53.743
He thought there was a chance
it'd make you a worse shot.

00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:56.378
‐ Oh. And the positive side?

00:13:56.446 --> 00:13:59.114
‐ The one thing he did like
was how the assist

00:13:59.181 --> 00:14:01.951
made it easier to hit targets
from a long distance,

00:14:02.017 --> 00:14:05.187
unlike, you know,
sniping at someone in the flesh,

00:14:05.254 --> 00:14:07.923
which is insanely hard. I hear.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.660
‐ Yeah, I learned that
in the tutorial.

00:14:10.726 --> 00:14:12.928
‐ Sniping requires
tons of experience

00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:15.030
and making
the right calculations.

00:14:15.097 --> 00:14:18.768
To train, real snipers
have to fire hundreds of rounds

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:22.271
day after day,
over and over and over again.

00:14:22.337 --> 00:14:23.806
[gunshots]

00:14:25.441 --> 00:14:28.978
They even know how the wind
affects a bullet's trajectory.

00:14:29.044 --> 00:14:31.046
‐ When you said, "Directly,"

00:14:31.113 --> 00:14:34.083
you mean you never needed to use
your Bullet Circle at all.

00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:36.952
You took your shots without it.
You looked through the scope

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:38.821
and did all the aiming
for yourself.

00:14:38.888 --> 00:14:40.355
‐ That's right.

00:14:41.325 --> 00:14:42.693
LLENN: You didn't
touch the trigger

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:44.495
'til you knew
you were ready to fire.

00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:47.031
That way, you didn't
make any Bullet Lines.

00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:50.434
That's so awesome!

00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:53.504
Gosh, M, do you even know
what this means for us?

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.173
There's only one team left now.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.042
We can beat 'em!

00:14:58.109 --> 00:15:00.011
We'll get that gold medal!

00:15:00.077 --> 00:15:02.046
‐ We just might.

00:15:02.113 --> 00:15:04.181
Anyway, scan's coming up.

00:15:04.248 --> 00:15:05.983
‐ Eh? Oh, right.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.019
Can't believe
it's only been an hour.

00:15:08.085 --> 00:15:10.487
‐ Doesn't seem like it.

00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:12.389
‐ What's that?

00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:14.525
‐ Get ready.

00:15:17.794 --> 00:15:19.230
‐ [thinking]
Last time we checked,

00:15:19.296 --> 00:15:21.632
there was only one team
in the desert.

00:15:21.698 --> 00:15:26.403
I wonder where they are now
and how far away.

00:15:33.377 --> 00:15:35.746
‐ [gasps]
‐ [gasps]

00:15:41.152 --> 00:15:43.955
I‐I got shot.

00:15:45.522 --> 00:15:47.424
Was it a sniper?

00:15:47.491 --> 00:15:50.627
How'd they get here so fast?

00:15:53.497 --> 00:15:55.132
‐ LLENN! I got you!

00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:56.667
‐ [groans]

00:16:02.206 --> 00:16:04.075
‐ [groans]

00:16:11.983 --> 00:16:12.917
Hang on to something.

00:16:12.984 --> 00:16:14.151
[bullet pings]

00:16:15.619 --> 00:16:18.089
[single shots whizzing]

00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:21.792
Hurry. Use your medkit!

00:16:21.858 --> 00:16:24.395
‐ Oh, r‐right.

00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:27.631
I can't lose, not now,

00:16:27.698 --> 00:16:30.634
not after making it this far.

00:16:35.806 --> 00:16:38.709
‐ Don't worry.
We're out of range now.

00:16:38.775 --> 00:16:40.711
Woman: Damn it, they got away.

00:16:40.777 --> 00:16:42.346
Woman #2: Boss,
looks like they're heading

00:16:42.413 --> 00:16:43.915
to the other side of the lake.

00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:47.084
‐ Hey, Anna, anything else
moving out there?

00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:49.486
‐ No, just the ones on the lake.

00:16:49.553 --> 00:16:50.521
Boss: Perfect.

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:52.056
That confirms it.

00:16:52.123 --> 00:16:54.992
There's only two players left
on that team.

00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:56.961
We're heading
to the wasteland, ladies.

00:16:57.028 --> 00:16:59.696
[radio] Start the truck,
and let's go get 'em!

00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:06.037
M: They're more
than a klick away.

00:17:06.103 --> 00:17:07.704
We're safe for now.

00:17:07.771 --> 00:17:09.106
‐ Sorry.

00:17:09.173 --> 00:17:10.241
It's my fault.

00:17:10.307 --> 00:17:12.676
I was dumb.
I let my guard down.

00:17:12.743 --> 00:17:14.946
‐ There's nothing
to be sorry about.

00:17:15.012 --> 00:17:16.981
Even if you know
what to look for,

00:17:17.048 --> 00:17:20.918
spotting a sniper's not easy,
especially at 600 meters,

00:17:20.985 --> 00:17:24.421
and if they're hiding, there's
no way you'd ever see 'em.

00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:26.857
‐ Now what are we gonna do?

00:17:26.924 --> 00:17:29.626
‐ We'll get as far away
from them as we can.

00:17:29.693 --> 00:17:32.396
It'll give us a chance
to top off our HP.

00:17:32.463 --> 00:17:34.531
‐ Want me to give you a shot?

00:17:34.598 --> 00:17:36.233
‐ Please.

00:17:38.635 --> 00:17:40.337
‐ They were far away before.

00:17:40.404 --> 00:17:43.040
How'd they get
so close that fast?

00:17:43.107 --> 00:17:44.108
‐ We got us a vehicle,

00:17:44.175 --> 00:17:46.543
so they probably
got themselves one, too.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.612
‐ Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:51.682
‐ It's just a guess,
but as the tourney winds down,

00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:53.617
they'd make
more vehicles available.

00:17:53.684 --> 00:17:56.087
That way, teams can get
to each other quicker.

00:17:56.153 --> 00:17:59.656
I bet they got a four‐by‐four
or truck or something.

00:17:59.723 --> 00:18:02.393
Also, they gotta have
someone on the team

00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:03.694
who knows how to drive it.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.930
‐ [groans] And a sniper.

00:18:05.997 --> 00:18:08.699
‐ Don't beat
yourself up about it.

00:18:08.765 --> 00:18:11.435
Like you said,
you're a lucky girl.

00:18:11.502 --> 00:18:12.904
‐ How? I totally got shot.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.839
‐ True, but you didn't die.

00:18:17.108 --> 00:18:19.543
If a bullet hit you
ten centimeters lower,

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.478
it would have hit
your heart or lungs,

00:18:21.545 --> 00:18:22.914
and that would have been that.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.082
‐ Yeah, I guess.

00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:28.485
‐ Also, that was probably as far
as that sniper could shoot

00:18:28.552 --> 00:18:30.087
and still hit something.

00:18:30.154 --> 00:18:32.889
‐ Yeah, but they
managed to hit you, too.

00:18:32.957 --> 00:18:36.827
‐ That was luck.
Don't forget I'm a big target.

00:18:36.893 --> 00:18:40.064
I saw their Line going
for my thigh, but I ignored it.

00:18:40.131 --> 00:18:44.135
I could tell by the sound,
their rifle was a 7.26 mil.

00:18:44.201 --> 00:18:46.803
It had a short firing interval,
so it's an auto.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.240
That means their mag
held at least ten rounds.

00:18:49.306 --> 00:18:51.742
It can perforate you
faster than a bolt‐action can,

00:18:51.808 --> 00:18:54.045
so keep that in mind
for next time.

00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:59.083
‐ I will. I promise I'll keep
my guard up 'til this is over.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:00.451
I won't get cocky.

00:19:00.517 --> 00:19:02.486
‐ That's the spirit.

00:19:02.553 --> 00:19:04.721
‐ Now what?
You know where we're going?

00:19:04.788 --> 00:19:06.723
‐ The wasteland on your left.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.126
I was thinking
we'd go ashore there.

00:19:09.193 --> 00:19:10.161
‐ But they have trucks,

00:19:10.227 --> 00:19:12.229
so shouldn't we head
for the marsh?

00:19:12.296 --> 00:19:13.730
‐ We're low on gas.

00:19:13.797 --> 00:19:17.168
There's no guarantee
we'd make it across the lake.

Lots of rocks to take cover
behind and snipe from.

what about that letter?

Might as well.
