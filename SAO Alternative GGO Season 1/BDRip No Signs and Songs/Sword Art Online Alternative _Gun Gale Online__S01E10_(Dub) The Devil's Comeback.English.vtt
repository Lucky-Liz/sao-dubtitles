WEBVTT

00:00:01.306 --> 00:00:02.707
‐ I left the mags behind!

00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:05.243
‐ No! We gotta get out of here!

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.844
‐ I need 'em!

00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:10.015
‐ [gasps]
‐ [automatic gunfire]

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:12.683
That's a different team.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.485
Fuka, give me a blast zone

00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:16.721
100 meters up ahead
and 30 meters across.

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:19.057
‐ Leave it to me.

00:00:20.525 --> 00:00:21.926
[David groans]

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.030
I missed 'em.

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.733
[radio] Fall back, everyone.
We're leaving the dome.

00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:37.208
‐ Thanks for helping us
out of that jam, Boss.

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:39.777
‐ Well, it wasn't
'cause I wanted to help.

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:41.646
MMTM's a tough bunch,

00:00:41.712 --> 00:00:44.015
and this was the perfect chance
to take 'em out.

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:46.151
I didn't want to pass that up.

00:00:46.217 --> 00:00:47.852
Too bad they got away.

00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:49.820
But that's how it goes.

00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:52.590
So how 'bout we have
our rematch right here?

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:55.660
Or someplace else.
Wherever. Your call.

00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:57.462
‐ LLENN: Sorry.
‐ Hmm?

00:00:57.528 --> 00:01:00.365
‐ I can't fight you right now.

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:02.867
‐ What?! You can't back out!

00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.935
Remember, after
the last tourney, we said‐‐

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.239
‐ I know. It's just that...

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:09.740
‐ Let me handle this.

00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:12.043
See, she was told
that if Pitohui died here

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.212
and didn't win,
she'd kill herself in real life.

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:17.582
And since LLENN cares about her,
she wants to stop her.

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:18.583
‐ Hey!

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.185
‐ Karen.
‐ Uh...

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:24.255
‐ Talk to me.
I might be able to help.

00:02:57.617 --> 00:03:01.854
‐ I'm gonna make her pay.
That bitch! That monster!

00:03:03.123 --> 00:03:05.592
Man: In real life,
we're all gun owners,

00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:06.959
licensed and legal.

00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:08.495
We go hunting all the time.

00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.997
We used G.G.O.
to practice before,

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:13.900
but this is our first time
playing in a tournament.

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:16.569
‐ Oh, so you're experienced.

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:19.439
Yeah. We have
real‐world experience,

00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:21.041
not like most of these gamers.

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:23.910
We can even shoot
without the Bullet Line.

00:03:23.976 --> 00:03:26.413
So what do you say?
Want to team up?

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.550
Pito: Mm, I don't know.
What happens at the end

00:03:30.617 --> 00:03:32.319
if we're
the last teams standing?

00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:34.787
‐ Oh, we'd let you win,
of course.

00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:36.723
We wouldn't have
a problem with that.

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.725
‐ Right, guys?
‐ Yeah, sure.

00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:40.193
‐ I'm cool with that.
‐ Take it.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.595
‐ Hmm.

00:03:42.662 --> 00:03:43.930
Are you okay with this, too,

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:46.166
or are you letting the boys
decide for you?

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:47.600
‐ [gasps]

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:49.569
[sighs]

00:03:49.636 --> 00:03:51.404
‐ Oh, she'll go along with it.

00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:53.940
Yeah she's not
into shooting people,

00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:56.076
even if it's just a game.

00:03:56.143 --> 00:03:58.945
We tried telling her it's not
the same as real life, but‐‐

00:03:59.012 --> 00:04:00.847
Eh, don't worry about her.

00:04:00.913 --> 00:04:03.650
She won't cause
any problems for you.

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:05.018
‐ Hmph.

00:04:05.085 --> 00:04:07.354
‐ So wanna team up with us?

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.424
‐ I'm sorry.
I don't think it'll work.

00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:13.093
‐ Why?
‐ I wanted to see if I

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.795
could do this with my team,
so I should stick to that.

00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:19.299
‐ Oh, well, that's okay.

00:04:19.366 --> 00:04:21.601
Thanks for taking
the time to talk.

00:04:21.668 --> 00:04:24.504
We'll head back to our spot
behind those trees.

00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:28.241
Don't worry. We won't attack
until the next scan.

00:04:28.308 --> 00:04:29.442
‐ Sounds good.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.745
And I promise my guys
won't attack you, either.

00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:34.381
Any objections, boys?

00:04:34.447 --> 00:04:36.916
‐ Nope.
‐ I'm good.

00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:42.089
Pito: Mm.

00:04:44.357 --> 00:04:45.292
‐ [sighs]

00:04:45.358 --> 00:04:46.859
‐ [gasps]

00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:48.828
[gunshot]

00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:51.798
‐ [groans]

00:04:51.864 --> 00:04:53.133
‐ What the hell'd you do‐‐

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:55.602
‐ You promised you wouldn‐‐

00:04:55.668 --> 00:04:56.636
[gags]

00:04:56.703 --> 00:04:58.538
‐ I promised my guys wouldn't.

00:04:58.605 --> 00:05:01.408
Devil's in the details.

00:05:01.474 --> 00:05:02.575
[gunfire]

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.152
‐ I got her.
‐ Don't bother.

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.722
It's bad form to shoot people
who don't wanna shoot back.

00:05:15.788 --> 00:05:18.291
[laughing]

00:05:18.358 --> 00:05:20.527
‐ [panting]

00:05:20.593 --> 00:05:22.429
She's insane.

00:05:22.495 --> 00:05:23.896
She killed them all.

00:05:23.963 --> 00:05:25.598
She's not human.

00:05:25.665 --> 00:05:30.937
There's only one way
to deal with vermin like her.

00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:35.142
You hunt them down...

00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:38.011
and exterminate 'em!

00:06:00.867 --> 00:06:02.535
‐ All right.

00:06:02.602 --> 00:06:05.338
Time to get our game face on.

00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:11.846
[insects chirping]

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.148
LLENN: There's PM4.

00:06:13.215 --> 00:06:15.950
I can't believe
they're still alive.

00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:20.189
If a couple dozen players can't
beat 'em, how the heck can I?

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.924
Fuka: LLENN, you see the scan?!

00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:25.327
The Machine Gun Lovers
were killed.

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.065
I think T‐S are the ones
that got 'em.

00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:35.137
And KKHC's still alive.

00:06:35.204 --> 00:06:39.708
‐ Those two, PM4 and SHINC,
MMTM and us.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.643
That's six teams left.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.913
‐ Time to go, LLENN.
You ready to do this?

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.648
‐ Yup.

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.923
Boss: Get psyched, ladies.
We're going after PM4.

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:58.060
Operation Sweets is a go.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.065
‐ Pito,
the Amazon team's advancing.

00:07:03.132 --> 00:07:05.834
1,600 meters and closing.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.304
When they get to 1,300,
we'll open up on 'em.

00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:12.207
Gimme the M107A1,
and I'll pick 'em off.

00:07:12.274 --> 00:07:15.110
‐ What? How come
you get to use it?

00:07:15.177 --> 00:07:16.411
‐ Don't take this the wrong way,

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.713
but I'm a better sniper
than you.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.015
‐ Aww.

00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:23.118
Fine. It's probably
for the best, anyway.

00:07:23.185 --> 00:07:25.854
LLENN's coming, and I should
save my strength for her.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.656
Anna: Enemy spotted.

00:07:27.722 --> 00:07:28.857
It's M and his shield,

00:07:28.923 --> 00:07:30.892
1,600 meters ahead.

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:32.127
‐ That far?

00:07:32.194 --> 00:07:35.464
His effective range
is only 800 meters.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.899
‐ Why's he in position so early?

00:07:37.966 --> 00:07:40.402
‐ He switched his main
for a different rifle,

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:43.238
a rifle that can shoot
farther than a kilometer.

00:07:43.305 --> 00:07:47.342
Man: You think they know
what they're walking into?

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:50.079
‐ Doesn't matter.
Once they get in range,

00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:53.515
I'll start firing and
take out as many as I can.

00:07:55.084 --> 00:07:56.618
Anna: 1,500 meters.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:00.422
‐ I bet he's got some kind
of anti‐materiel rifle.

00:08:00.489 --> 00:08:04.193
He's letting us get closer
so we can be easier targets.

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.762
He won't be using
his Bullet Line, so stay sharp.

00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:11.166
We're getting close to the point
of no return, ladies.

00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:13.768
Stand by for my command.
Let's give 'em hell!

00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:14.936
Team: Roger that!

00:08:15.004 --> 00:08:16.938
Man: 1,300 meters.

00:08:17.006 --> 00:08:19.441
‐ I'll take out their leader.

00:08:19.508 --> 00:08:21.910
You bring down the sniper
on the far right.

00:08:21.976 --> 00:08:24.513
‐ Might as well
get this ball rolling.

00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:27.882
Lock and load! Don't forget!
Three seconds, then two!

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:29.318
Charge!

00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:31.886
‐ Yee‐haw!

00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:33.088
‐ Here they come.

00:08:33.155 --> 00:08:35.590
‐ Damn. They know
their battle tactics.

00:08:35.657 --> 00:08:39.028
Changing targets.
I got the short one in front.

00:08:39.094 --> 00:08:41.596
You take the ones
on either side.

00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:44.199
[deep breath]

00:08:45.534 --> 00:08:46.868
‐ Holy cow!

00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:48.303
If I didn't dodge when I did,

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.305
that totally
would have cut me in half.

00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:52.641
‐ Whoa!

00:08:52.707 --> 00:08:54.009
Hah! You missed!

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:56.111
Boss: Change direction
every three seconds!

00:08:56.178 --> 00:08:59.148
Don't stop for more than two!
Keep going!

00:08:59.214 --> 00:09:02.051
Man: They're moving so much,
I can't get a bead on 'em.

00:09:02.117 --> 00:09:04.019
‐ I need your help
with the blonde one.

00:09:04.086 --> 00:09:05.720
Light her up with your Line.

00:09:05.787 --> 00:09:08.290
When she dodges it,
I'll take the shot.

00:09:08.357 --> 00:09:10.859
‐ Only 900 meters left to go.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.361
‐ [Bullet Line hums]
‐ Anna!

00:09:13.795 --> 00:09:15.097
‐ [laughs]

00:09:16.731 --> 00:09:17.666
‐ Damn it.

00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:21.770
They got Anna.

00:09:21.836 --> 00:09:25.007
Toma: It's okay, Boss.
She did her job.

00:09:25.074 --> 00:09:26.675
She bought us
the time we need.

00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:28.010
Man: Who's next?

00:09:28.077 --> 00:09:29.211
‐ Wait.

00:09:32.647 --> 00:09:36.118
Man #2: They're holding
at 855 meters.

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:38.253
We should still
be out of their range.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.954
Not sure what they're
up to, though.

00:09:40.022 --> 00:09:44.293
‐ I don't get it either.
Don't let your guard down.

00:09:46.495 --> 00:09:48.263
Boss: Sophie, you're up.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.699
‐ Roger that. Here I go.

00:09:54.903 --> 00:09:56.138
‐ [speaking Russian]

00:09:58.607 --> 00:10:01.576
‐ Ladies, knock their socks off.

00:10:05.114 --> 00:10:06.348
‐ What the hell?!

00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:08.483
Pito: Incoming! Take cover!

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:21.630
[M panting]

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:26.168
No way. They got themselves
a PTRD‐41,

00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:28.570
the Degtyaryov anti‐tank rifle.

00:10:28.637 --> 00:10:32.474
‐ Say your prayers,
rotten bastards!

00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:34.843
Moe: I still can't believe

00:10:34.909 --> 00:10:37.946
we finally got our hands
on an anti‐tank rifle.

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:40.782
Risa: We couldn't have gotten it
if it weren't for Sinon's help!

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.718
‐ It's great, but a big piece
of gear like that

00:10:43.785 --> 00:10:45.587
will be hard to carry
during battle.

00:10:45.654 --> 00:10:48.590
Me and Kana are both
strong enough to carry it.

00:10:48.657 --> 00:10:51.526
Plus, our shoulders
can be used to stabilize it.

00:10:51.593 --> 00:10:53.495
‐ No way. I don't like it.

00:10:53.562 --> 00:10:55.997
If one of you guys gets shot,
we lose a player,

00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:57.499
and we can't use
the gun anymore.

00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:00.135
‐ Actually, it'd be better
if one of us gets shot.

00:11:00.202 --> 00:11:03.472
In fact, if it comes down to it,
I'd happily die for the cause.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.674
‐ [gasps]
‐ Remember?

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.976
In S.J., a corpse is
an Immortal Object

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:10.845
and stays put for ten minutes
where it was killed.

00:11:10.912 --> 00:11:13.548
That means for ten minutes,
my body will be

00:11:13.615 --> 00:11:16.885
an invincible pedestal
and block all the bullets.

00:11:20.989 --> 00:11:24.626
We brought along something
special just for this moment

00:11:24.693 --> 00:11:26.961
It's the ultimate anti‐M weapon.

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:29.264
We call it the M‐gun!

00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:31.300
Time to die!

00:11:34.936 --> 00:11:37.472
M: They have
a Degtyaryov anti‐tank rifle!

00:11:37.539 --> 00:11:39.274
One shot from it,
and you're dead!

00:11:39.341 --> 00:11:41.376
Find some cover, and stay down!

00:11:44.979 --> 00:11:46.715
Toma: My turn!

00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:50.485
‐ [grunts]

00:11:51.886 --> 00:11:53.655
‐ You're finished!

00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:08.970
‐ The .50‐caliber's trashed.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.407
[gasps]

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:16.578
‐ Now that's what
I'm talking about.

00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:22.284
‐ The shield shattered.

00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:23.885
We did it.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.154
[sobs]

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.956
Thanks, Sophie! We did it!

00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:31.860
‐ All right!
That takes care of M's shield.

00:12:31.926 --> 00:12:33.762
Time for the next assault.

00:12:33.828 --> 00:12:35.564
Get ready to charge!

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.466
Tanya, take point again.

00:12:37.532 --> 00:12:39.968
Toma, drop the rifle,
and take flank.

00:12:40.035 --> 00:12:42.804
Roza, as soon as you're
in range, light 'em up.

00:12:42.871 --> 00:12:43.938
Team: Roger that!

00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:45.874
‐ Let's go get 'em!

00:12:47.376 --> 00:12:49.378
M: [thinking]
Why are they so gung‐ho

00:12:49.444 --> 00:12:50.845
about charging at us?

00:12:50.912 --> 00:12:53.482
With my shield and
the .50 gone, flanking us

00:12:53.548 --> 00:12:55.884
would be a better plan
than attacking head‐on.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:00.322
They're crazy to run
into oncoming fire, unless...

00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:02.257
It's part of their strategy.

00:13:02.324 --> 00:13:03.458
[fires rifle]

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:08.563
‐ I'm hit!
It's just my arm, though!

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.332
He really doesn't use his Line.

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:13.002
He figured out
our movements, Boss.

00:13:13.068 --> 00:13:15.537
If we can't evade,
we can't move any closer.

00:13:15.604 --> 00:13:17.972
‐ We're gonna try anyway.

00:13:19.908 --> 00:13:20.875
It's time.

00:13:20.942 --> 00:13:22.244
LLENN, you're up!

00:13:22.311 --> 00:13:23.612
Go!

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:24.713
‐ Roger!

00:13:27.184 --> 00:13:28.552
‐ A pincer attack?

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:30.187
‐ Yeah. Here's the plan.

00:13:30.254 --> 00:13:33.424
At the 14‐minute mark,
we'll confirm PM4's position,

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.426
then attack 'em from the south.

00:13:35.492 --> 00:13:38.029
Once we're set,
you hit 'em from the north

00:13:38.095 --> 00:13:39.596
9 1/2 minutes later.

00:13:39.663 --> 00:13:42.133
Move in, and take Pitohui out.

00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:43.734
‐ I don't know about this.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.503
That's nine minutes
you'll be fighting PM4 alone.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.039
‐ Don't you worry.

00:13:48.105 --> 00:13:50.141
We have something that'll
punch through M's shield.

00:13:50.207 --> 00:13:52.876
They won't have time
to realize we're the diversion.

00:13:52.943 --> 00:13:55.479
And besides,
even if they wipe us out,

00:13:55.546 --> 00:13:57.081
it'll still be worth it.

00:13:57.148 --> 00:13:58.415
‐ But still...

00:13:58.482 --> 00:14:00.851
‐ Look, this isn't S.A.O.
It's G.G.O.

00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:04.021
No one's supposed to die
for real if they die in here,

00:14:04.088 --> 00:14:06.890
not if I can help it, anyway.

00:14:06.957 --> 00:14:08.792
So are we good?

00:14:08.859 --> 00:14:11.428
‐ [gasps]

00:14:11.495 --> 00:14:12.896
We're good.

00:14:12.963 --> 00:14:15.232
And next time,
all the sweets are on me.

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:17.201
‐ Perfect! As a matter of fact,

00:14:17.268 --> 00:14:20.204
Operation Sweets
is what we'll call this thing.

00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:21.572
‐ [giggles]

00:14:22.673 --> 00:14:24.241
Let 'em have it, Fuka!

00:14:24.308 --> 00:14:26.477
‐ Unleash the pink!

00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:29.380
[smoke bombs exploding]

00:14:29.446 --> 00:14:31.148
Boss: LLENN, you're up! Go!

00:14:31.215 --> 00:14:32.583
‐ Roger!

00:14:33.584 --> 00:14:36.653
I'm comin' to get you, Pito.

00:14:38.122 --> 00:14:39.056
‐ [laughs]

00:14:39.123 --> 00:14:40.457
There you are, LLENN.

00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:43.227

her throat out,

00:14:43.294 --> 00:14:44.595
I'm gonna‐‐ [gasps]

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:51.502

Die!

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.739
[gunshot echoes]

00:14:58.409 --> 00:14:59.676

‐ [laughs]

00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:07.218
I did it. I did it!

00:15:07.284 --> 00:15:09.286
And it wasn't even a big deal!

00:15:09.353 --> 00:15:10.487

Pito!

00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:31.675
Is this it?
Is this how I get to die?!

00:15:31.742 --> 00:15:34.711
‐ Stop it! You can't die yet!

00:15:34.778 --> 00:15:39.183
‐ [gasping]
I'm gonna die. Finally.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.217
[laughs]

00:15:40.284 --> 00:15:41.252
‐ No!

00:15:41.318 --> 00:15:44.788
Please, I'm begging you, stop!

00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:48.492
[sobbing]

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:51.595

crying about, Goushi?

00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:56.600
[laughs]

00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:58.369
I haven't died yet!

00:15:58.435 --> 00:15:59.870
[laughs]

00:15:59.936 --> 00:16:03.940
I'm still here.
I'm not dead yet.

00:16:04.008 --> 00:16:05.142
Whoo!

00:16:05.209 --> 00:16:07.078
That was fun!

00:16:07.144 --> 00:16:08.479
[laughs]

00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:11.215
‐ Stop it!
I know you don't wanna die!

00:16:11.282 --> 00:16:14.185
You're scared just like me,
and that's okay!

00:16:14.251 --> 00:16:16.720
Let's resign and forget
about this whole thing!

00:16:16.787 --> 00:16:18.955
You don't know
what you're talking about.

00:16:19.023 --> 00:16:21.225
This is fun! I'm having fun,

00:16:21.292 --> 00:16:24.428
and I'm still here,
and I'm gonna keep going!

00:16:24.495 --> 00:16:27.231
I'll keep going and going

00:16:27.298 --> 00:16:31.002

She passed out, so‐‐

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.376
Wait. Is she using
the NerveGear,

00:16:39.443 --> 00:16:41.745
the rig they had for S.A.O.?

00:16:41.812 --> 00:16:44.748
M: Listen up. We're gonna
fall back and regroup.

00:16:44.815 --> 00:16:47.084
Get to the log cabin
as fast as you can.

00:16:49.153 --> 00:16:50.687
‐ Oh, man, what a waste

00:16:50.754 --> 00:16:53.390
of a perfectly good batch
of smoke bombs.

00:16:53.457 --> 00:16:54.458

Boss: No, she's alive.

00:16:58.895 --> 00:17:02.299
Bet she lost a big, fat chunk
of her HP, though.

00:17:02.366 --> 00:17:03.834
‐ Thank God.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.936
Boss: They're heading
for that log cabin.

00:17:06.003 --> 00:17:09.306
If you go now, you can hit 'em
before she recovers.

00:17:09.373 --> 00:17:11.075
Fuka: You wanna?

00:17:11.142 --> 00:17:12.543
I can meet you there.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:13.810
‐ [sighs]

00:17:13.877 --> 00:17:16.713
If someone else wounded Pito
and I killed her

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.615
would that be
considered cheating,

00:17:18.682 --> 00:17:21.585
or would it count
as beating her fair and square?

00:17:21.652 --> 00:17:23.420
Boss: I can't answer that one.

00:17:23.487 --> 00:17:24.821
Fuka: Me neither.

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:26.823
‐ Know who can?

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.525
‐ The one doing the deed.

00:17:28.592 --> 00:17:29.860
Both: You!

00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:38.035
We're gonna massacre PM4!

00:17:38.102 --> 00:17:40.871
We'll hit 'em hard
with another pincer attack!

00:17:40.937 --> 00:17:42.839
No one kills Pito but me.

00:17:42.906 --> 00:17:44.241
It's her own fault

00:17:44.308 --> 00:17:46.410
for letting her guard down
and getting wounded.

00:17:46.477 --> 00:17:48.212
Those are the breaks in G.G.O.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:51.248
I don't care if she's hurt.
She's mine!

00:17:51.315 --> 00:17:54.985
That's why I'm here, and I
won't stop 'til I kill her!

00:17:55.052 --> 00:17:56.353
‐ Attagirl!

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.222

00:17:58.289 --> 00:17:59.223
Huh?

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.624
LLENN, look East!

It's MMTM!

00:18:06.797 --> 00:18:09.333
‐ Don't worry
about LF and SHINC.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.834
Get inside that cabin.

00:18:10.901 --> 00:18:14.338
We'll hit PM4
before they can heal.

00:18:14.405 --> 00:18:16.640
This is our chance to win this,

00:18:16.707 --> 00:18:18.309
so don't hold back.

00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:22.346
Give it everything, your lives,
your courage, and your bullets.

00:18:22.413 --> 00:18:23.347

00:18:25.349 --> 00:18:28.052
You'll ruin everything!

00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:31.755
David: Here we go!

00:18:33.424 --> 00:18:35.326
M: We got company.

00:18:35.392 --> 00:18:37.494
Come on, Pito. Wake up.

00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:40.564
We're out of time.
They'll be up here any second.

00:18:40.631 --> 00:18:42.066
[door opens]

00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:44.868
‐ The contract says
to keep my mouth shut

00:18:44.935 --> 00:18:47.638
and follow orders,
but I gotta ask something.

00:18:47.704 --> 00:18:49.206
‐ What is it?

00:18:49.273 --> 00:18:53.410
‐ What's the deal with you
and, you know, Pitohui?

00:18:53.477 --> 00:18:54.678
‐ Huh?

00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:57.414
‐ What is she to you?

00:18:57.481 --> 00:19:00.584
I mean, it's like you're
protecting her with your life.

00:19:00.651 --> 00:19:03.254
She mean that much to you?

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.755
‐ [sighs]

00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:09.993
Yeah. Yeah, she does.

00:19:10.061 --> 00:19:11.328
‐ [chuckles]

00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:13.097
You guys copy that?

00:19:13.164 --> 00:19:15.299
We got a couple
of lovebirds here.

00:19:15.366 --> 00:19:18.902
We'll keep 'em from coming up
as long as we can.

00:19:18.969 --> 00:19:22.673
If Sleeping Beauty wakes up
in time, you tell her,

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:25.442
"Kill 'em all. Go nuts."

00:19:28.345 --> 00:19:29.680
‐ [gasps] Oh, my gosh.

00:19:29.746 --> 00:19:31.382
‐ They're trapped!
‐ [Fuka groans]

00:19:31.448 --> 00:19:33.684
You know it's crazy
to go in there now, right?

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.286
‐ Yeah, I know! I don't care!

00:19:35.352 --> 00:19:39.656
[thinking] Dear God,
please keep Pito safe,

00:19:39.723 --> 00:19:43.694
at least,
until I kill her anyway.

00:19:51.602 --> 00:19:52.836
[both gasp]

00:20:27.538 --> 00:20:29.473
[gunfire]

00:20:50.761 --> 00:20:51.762
[explosion]

00:20:51.828 --> 00:20:52.929
‐ What was that?

00:20:52.996 --> 00:20:54.531
‐ I think a plasma grenade.

00:20:54.598 --> 00:20:57.068
‐ Did someone lob it
from outside?

00:20:57.134 --> 00:21:00.071
David: Focus.
Pitohui's the mission.

00:21:01.072 --> 00:21:03.174
‐ [gunshot]
‐ Open fire on the wall!

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.043
‐ [yelling]

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.978
David: Hold your fire!

00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:10.547
‐ [shotgun pumps]
‐ [gasps]

00:21:10.614 --> 00:21:12.483
‐ [groans]
‐ Lax!

00:21:14.018 --> 00:21:15.919
‐ Suck on this, you bastard!

00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:19.523
[groaning]

00:21:24.395 --> 00:21:25.329
‐ [gasps]

00:21:30.434 --> 00:21:32.336
[explosion]

00:21:37.908 --> 00:21:39.876
[photon sword hums]

00:21:39.943 --> 00:21:44.181
David: In the last B.o.B.,
the third one,

00:21:44.248 --> 00:21:47.351
there was a player with
a name I never heard before.

00:21:47.418 --> 00:21:50.921
He fought
with one of those things,

00:21:50.987 --> 00:21:53.157
a powerful, short‐range weapon

00:21:53.224 --> 00:21:55.959
that doesn't exist
in real life,

00:21:56.027 --> 00:21:58.795
a sword in a world of guns,

00:21:58.862 --> 00:22:00.931
a photon sword.

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:06.137
‐ Now this is fun.
