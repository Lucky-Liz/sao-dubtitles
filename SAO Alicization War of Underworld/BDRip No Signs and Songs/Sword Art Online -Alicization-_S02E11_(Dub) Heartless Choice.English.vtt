IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT THAT’S
WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO TELL YOU.

00:10:29.234 --> 00:10:30.002
( both gasp )

00:10:36.254 --> 00:10:38.625
Klein: I SWEAR. HE’S IN A COMA,

00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:42.532
AND HE STILL MANAGED TO GET
CAUGHT UP IN SOMETHING CRAZY.

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:45.205
I MEAN,
A FULL-ON A.I. CALLED ALICE

00:10:45.272 --> 00:10:48.444
WHO WAS BORN IN A VIRTUAL WORLD
MADE BY THE S.D.F.?

00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:51.417
( groans )
THIS IS WAY BEYOND VR GAMES,

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.322
AND THERE’S NO GOIN’ BACK.

00:10:53.388 --> 00:10:55.526
Silica: POOR ALICE.
SHE’S SO SPECIAL,

00:10:55.592 --> 00:10:57.629
AND THEY JUST WANT HER
TO FLY FIGHTER JETS.

00:10:57.696 --> 00:11:00.836
Yui: ULTIMATELY, YES,
BUT THEY WON’T RIGHT AWAY.

00:11:00.903 --> 00:11:02.205
RATH WILL PROBABLY USE HER

00:11:02.272 --> 00:11:05.178
TO DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNOLOGY
TO THE WORLD FIRST.

00:11:05.245 --> 00:11:08.084
THE HIJACKERS ABOARD
THE OCEAN TURTLE, HOWEVER,

00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:10.755
AREN’T INTERESTED
IN DEMONSTRATIONS.

00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:12.126
I THINK, ONCE THEY GET HER,

00:11:12.193 --> 00:11:14.363
THEY’LL USE HER
FOR WHAT SHE WAS INTENDED.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.268
Klein: KNOW ANYTHING ELSE
ABOUT THOSE CREEPS,

00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:18.138
LIKE WHO THEY ARE
OR WHERE THEY’RE FROM?

00:11:18.205 --> 00:11:20.109
Yui: I CAN’T CONFIRM IT,

00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:23.481
BUT I THINK THEY’RE
U.S. MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE.

00:11:23.548 --> 00:11:24.717
- ( group gasps )
- Klein: WHAT?!

00:11:24.783 --> 00:11:25.853
Lisbeth: THEY’RE BEHIND IT?!

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:27.789
O-OH, MY GOD.

00:11:27.856 --> 00:11:30.929
Yui: AGAIN, I CAN’T CONFIRM
THEY’RE INVOLVED WITH THIS,

00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:35.472
BUT IF THEY ARE AND ALICE
DOES FALL INTO THEIR HANDS,

00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:37.376
THEY’LL USE HER
FOR DRONE WARFARE.

00:11:37.443 --> 00:11:42.686
I KNOW DADDY AND MOMMY WOULDN’T
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO HER,

00:11:42.753 --> 00:11:43.955
BECAUSE ALICE--

00:11:44.023 --> 00:11:46.127
ALICE IS PROOF!

00:11:46.194 --> 00:11:48.532
HER EXISTENCE PROVES
ALL VR WORLDS,

00:11:48.598 --> 00:11:50.536
STARTING WITH "S.A.O.,"
ARE REAL,

00:11:50.602 --> 00:11:52.907
THAT THOSE WHO LIVED IN THEM
HAD REAL LIVES!

00:11:52.974 --> 00:11:56.047
SHE’S THE RESULT OF MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF THE TIME, ENERGY,

00:11:56.114 --> 00:11:59.720
AND IMAGINATION
OF THOUSANDS OF HUMANS!

00:11:59.787 --> 00:12:03.227
( all gasp )

00:12:03.294 --> 00:12:05.832
Yui: I’M CONVINCED
BEYOND A DOUBT

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:09.640
SHE’S WHY THE SEED PACKAGE
WAS CREATED, ITS TRUE PURPOSE...

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.214
TO GIVE BIRTH
TO SOMEONE LIKE HER.

00:12:13.281 --> 00:12:15.285
THROUGHOUT ALL
THE CONNECTED WORLDS

00:12:15.352 --> 00:12:16.854
THAT SPRANG UP FROM THE SEED,

00:12:16.921 --> 00:12:20.662
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE LAUGHED,
CRIED, SUFFERED, AND LOVED.

00:12:20.729 --> 00:12:22.800
IT WAS THE RADIANCE
OF ALL THOSE SOULS

00:12:22.866 --> 00:12:25.004
SHIMMERING WITH LIFE
THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE

00:12:25.071 --> 00:12:29.147
FOR A NEW FORM OF HUMANITY
TO BE BORN IN THE UNDERWORLD.

00:12:29.213 --> 00:12:30.783
DADDY AND MOMMY,

00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:35.759
LEAFA, KLEIN, LISBETH,
SILICA, AGIL, AND SINON,

00:12:35.825 --> 00:12:39.032
IT’S THE COMBINATION OF
YOUR HEARTS AND SO MANY OTHERS,

00:12:39.099 --> 00:12:41.104
ALL WOVEN TOGETHER
IN A BIG TAPESTRY,

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.973
THAT GAVE BIRTH TO ALICE!

00:12:45.211 --> 00:12:47.182
Lisbeth: YEAH, YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:12:47.249 --> 00:12:49.353
IT’S ALL CONNECTED,

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.960
PEOPLE AND TIME
AND OUR HEARTS, TOO,

00:12:53.028 --> 00:12:54.863
FLOWIN’ LIKE A BIG RIVER.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.100
Yui: EH?

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:57.837
Silica: IT’S OKAY, YUI.

00:12:57.903 --> 00:12:59.507
DON’T CRY.

00:12:59.574 --> 00:13:01.844
WE’LL RESCUE KIRITO AND ASUNA.

00:13:01.911 --> 00:13:06.053
I PROMISE, WE’LL DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO GET THEM OUT OF THIS.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.990
YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT.

00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:09.393
Klein: DAMN STRAIGHT.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.829
YOU SHOULD HAVE
COME TO US SOONER.

00:13:10.895 --> 00:13:13.000
IF THERE’S A CHANCE
TO GET ’EM OUT,

00:13:13.068 --> 00:13:14.137
HELL, WE’RE TAKING IT.

00:13:14.203 --> 00:13:15.572
Agil: YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

00:13:15.638 --> 00:13:17.343
I OWE ’EM AS MUCH AS ANYONE.

00:13:17.409 --> 00:13:20.048
’BOUT DAMN TIME
I STARTED PAYING ’EM BACK.

00:13:20.114 --> 00:13:22.753
Yui: YOU GUYS!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.023
( laughs )

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.161
SERIOUSLY, THANK YOU.

00:13:26.227 --> 00:13:28.030
Klein: MM-HMM.

00:13:28.097 --> 00:13:29.800
NOW THE HARD PART.

00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:33.140
THERE’S 30,000
AMERICAN VRMMO PLAYERS DIVING,

00:13:33.207 --> 00:13:35.746
AND SOON IT COULD
GO UP TO 100 THOU.

00:13:35.812 --> 00:13:38.851
THE HUMAN ARMY’S
JUST A BUNCH OF TARGETS TO THEM.

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:41.624
Lisbeth: WHAT’S STOPPING US FROM
DOING WHAT THE HIJACKERS DID?

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.231
WE CAN POST ON THE SAME
U.S. VRMMO SITES, TOO.

00:13:45.298 --> 00:13:47.302
WE’LL TELL THE PLAYERS
ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:50.241
AND THE FAKE BETA.
I’M PRETTY SURE THEY’LL LISTEN.

00:13:50.308 --> 00:13:51.811
Yui: AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL
IS A STRUGGLE

00:13:51.878 --> 00:13:54.717
FOR MILITARY SECRETS
BETWEEN JAPAN AND AMERICA.

00:13:54.784 --> 00:13:58.758
IF WE TOLD ANYONE ABOUT THAT,
IT WOULD JUST MAKE THIS WORSE.

00:13:58.824 --> 00:13:59.760
Agil: MM-HMM.

00:13:59.827 --> 00:14:01.064
Silica: IF WE SAID
THEY’D BE KILLING

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.101
REAL PEOPLE,
NOT AVATARS, MAYBE--

00:14:03.168 --> 00:14:04.837
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

00:14:04.903 --> 00:14:05.973
( Klein scoffs )

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.713
WELL, I SAY WE TEAR A PAGE
OUT OF THEIR PLAYBOOK.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.353
WE’LL POST A NOTICE
FOR THE BETA TEST OURSELVES.

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:14.690
THEN WE GET THE RATH GUYS
TO HAND OUT ACCOUNTS,

00:14:14.757 --> 00:14:18.631
AND I BET WE COULD GET 30,000
OR 40,000 LOGGED ON, EASY.

00:14:18.698 --> 00:14:21.503
Agil: THAT’S A GREAT IDEA, MAN,
BUT THERE’S ONE PROBLEM.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.608
Klein: YOU GONNA
TELL ME WHAT THAT IS?

00:14:23.675 --> 00:14:24.977
- Agil: THE TIME.
- ( Klein gasps )

00:14:25.044 --> 00:14:28.084
Agil: HERE IN JAPAN,
IT’S 4:30 IN THE MORNING.

00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:31.391
BESIDES US, THERE’S NOT
A WHOLE LOT OF FOLKS ONLINE.

00:14:31.457 --> 00:14:34.029
BUT IN LOS ANGELES,
IT’S HALF PAST NOON RIGHT NOW

00:14:34.096 --> 00:14:36.267
AND 3:30 IN NEW YORK.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.972
THE U.S. HAS WAY MORE
ACTIVE PLAYERS ONLINE.

00:14:39.039 --> 00:14:40.576
( Klein groans )

00:14:40.642 --> 00:14:42.846
Yui: AGIL IS CORRECT ABOUT THAT.

00:14:42.913 --> 00:14:46.254
WE COULDN’T GET THE NUMBER
OF PLAYERS WE NEED RIGHT NOW.

00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:48.758
IT WOULD BE
WAY LESS THAN 10,000.

00:14:48.825 --> 00:14:51.664
OUR ACCOUNTS WOULD BE
THE SAME LEVEL AS THE AMERICANS,

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.634
SO WE’D BE EVENLY MATCHED.

00:14:53.701 --> 00:14:55.606
FIGHTING ALL OF THEM OFF
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:14:55.672 --> 00:14:58.979
Lisbeth: BUT, LIKE, MAYBE RATH
HAS MORE GOD ACCOUNTS

00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:00.282
LIKE THE ONE ASUNA’S USING.

00:15:00.348 --> 00:15:02.419
WE CAN’T START FROM SCRATCH.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:05.458
WE’D NEED AS MUCH TIME AS KIRITO
TO LEVEL UP ENOUGH.

00:15:05.525 --> 00:15:07.963
Klein: CRAP. GAME OVER, THEN.

00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:09.033
- Yui: NO.
- ( both gasp )

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.504
Yui: THERE ARE STRONG ACCOUNTS,

00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:14.777
BOTH IN TERMS OF LEVEL
AND IN EQUIPMENT.

00:15:14.844 --> 00:15:17.549
THE AMERICANS’ DEFAULT ACCOUNTS
CAN’T COMPARE.

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:20.621
Lisbeth: REALLY?
HOW DO WE GET THEM?

00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:23.395
Yui: THAT’S THE BEST PART.
THE ACCOUNTS ARE ALREADY YOURS.

00:15:23.461 --> 00:15:24.897
THEY’RE THE ONES
YOU’RE LOGGED IN WITH NOW.

00:15:24.963 --> 00:15:26.534
Lisbeth: HUH?

00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:28.171
Yui: YOU MUST CONVERT THEM.

00:15:28.238 --> 00:15:30.108
IF YOU DO, THEN YOU

00:15:30.175 --> 00:15:33.682
AND ALL THE OTHER VRMMO PLAYERS
YOU RECRUIT WILL START

00:15:33.748 --> 00:15:36.020
WITH STRONGER ACCOUNTS
THAN THE AMERICANS.

00:15:36.087 --> 00:15:39.059
YOU’RE ALL LEVELED UP ALREADY.
JUST CONVERT, AND LOG IN!

00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:41.831
Klein: OF COURSE! WHY DIDN’T
ANY OF US THINK OF THAT?!

00:15:41.898 --> 00:15:47.076
Yui: ALTHOUGH I SHOULD MENTION
THIS PLAN INVOLVES SOME RISK.

00:15:47.143 --> 00:15:48.878
( crowd murmuring )

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:53.555
Lisbeth: WHAT I’M
ABOUT TO TELL YOU

00:15:53.622 --> 00:15:55.392
IS NOT SOME KIND OF PRANK.

00:15:55.458 --> 00:15:58.031
THERE’S A PLACE
CALLED THE UNDERWORLD.

00:15:58.097 --> 00:16:00.602
IT’S A VIRTUAL WORLD
BASED ON THE SEED,

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:02.739
MADE BY JAPANESE RESEARCHERS.

00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:05.445
AS I STAND HERE,
TENS OF THOUSANDS

00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:07.849
OF AMERICAN PLAYERS
ARE LOGGING IN TO IT.

00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:09.920
THEY’VE BEEN TOLD IT’S A BETA
FOR A HACK-AND-SLASH GAME

00:16:09.987 --> 00:16:12.626
AND THEY CAN KILL
ANYONE THEY COME ACROSS.

00:16:12.692 --> 00:16:15.232
BUT THE PEOPLE
OF THE UNDERWORLD ARE REAL.

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:17.169
THEY’RE NOT JUST NPCs.

00:16:17.235 --> 00:16:18.805
THEY’RE TRUE BOTTOM-UP A.I.s

00:16:18.871 --> 00:16:21.243
WITH FEELINGS
AND SOULS LIKE US.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.847
WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO PROTECT THEM,

00:16:22.913 --> 00:16:24.617
BUT THERE’S NO TIME
TO LEVEL UP THERE.

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.888
BUT IF YOU CONVERT
YOUR CHARACTER ACCOUNTS

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:29.593
TO THE UNDERWORLD,
WE CAN SAVE THEIR PEOPLE!

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.530
( crowd murmuring )

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.073
Sakuya: I KNOW YOU WELL,

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.810
AND I TRUST YOUR INTENTIONS.

00:16:37.877 --> 00:16:39.679
YOU WOULDN’T HAVE
CALLED US SO EARLY

00:16:39.746 --> 00:16:41.784
JUST SO YOU COULD PLAY
A TRICK ON US.

00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:45.425
AND THE FACT KIRITO HASN’T
LOGGED ON FOR OVER TEN DAYS

00:16:45.492 --> 00:16:49.166
SUGGESTS WHATEVER IS GOING ON
IS INDEED SERIOUS.

00:16:49.233 --> 00:16:52.439
BUT A.I.s WITH HUMAN SOULS

00:16:52.506 --> 00:16:55.212
AND THE U.S. MILITARY
OUT TO STEAL THEM,

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:58.150
IT ALL SEEMS SO FAR-FETCHED.

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.922
DIVING IN WOULD BE
THE ONLY WAY TO CONFIRM IT.

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:04.863
IN PRIVATE, YOU TOLD ME
YOU HAD OTHER CONCERNS,

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.738
THAT CONVERTING OUR ACCOUNTS
WOULD HAVE RISKS.

00:17:08.804 --> 00:17:11.911
YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN
WHAT THOSE ARE BEFORE WE DECIDE.

00:17:11.977 --> 00:17:13.080
Lisbeth: SURE.

00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:15.551
HERE’S WHAT I KNOW.

00:17:16.788 --> 00:17:19.560
THE UNDERWORLD
ISN’T A VRMMO GAME.

00:17:19.627 --> 00:17:21.730
IT’S A SIMULATED CIVILIZATION,

00:17:21.797 --> 00:17:25.705
SO YOU’LL BE FACED WITH
A FEW ISSUES ONCE YOU DIVE IN.

00:17:25.772 --> 00:17:29.046
THE FIRST ONE
IS THERE’S NO USER INTERFACE

00:17:29.113 --> 00:17:30.781
TO CALL UP AND MANIPULATE.

00:17:30.848 --> 00:17:34.022
ONCE YOU’RE LOGGED IN,
YOU CAN’T LOG YOURSELF OUT.

00:17:34.089 --> 00:17:35.558
( all gasp )

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:37.629
Lisbeth: THE ONLY WAY
FOR YOU TO LOG OUT

00:17:37.696 --> 00:17:40.068
IS BY DYING IN THERE.

00:17:40.135 --> 00:17:43.875
THAT BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER ISSUE
YOU ALL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.

00:17:43.942 --> 00:17:47.048
THE UNDERWORLD DOESN’T HAVE
A PAIN ABSORBER FUNCTION.

00:17:47.115 --> 00:17:48.651
( all gasping )

00:17:48.718 --> 00:17:51.691
IF YOU TAKE ENOUGH DAMAGE
TO DROP YOUR H.P. TO ZERO,

00:17:51.757 --> 00:17:54.029
YOU’LL EXPERIENCE
LOADS OF VIRTUAL PAIN.

00:17:54.096 --> 00:17:55.566

Lisbeth: AND FINALLY...

00:17:58.705 --> 00:18:00.708
THE UNDERWORLD’S
IN A CHAOTIC STATE RIGHT NOW,

00:18:00.775 --> 00:18:03.080
AND THE DEVS
CAN’T FULLY OPERATE IT,

00:18:03.147 --> 00:18:05.619
SO ONCE YOU CONVERT
YOUR CHARACTER DATA

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:08.424
TO THE UNDERWORLD,
THERE’S NO GUARANTEE

00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:10.161
YOU’LL BE ABLE
TO CONVERT IT BACK.

00:18:10.228 --> 00:18:12.866
AND WORSE, IF YOU DIE THERE,

00:18:12.933 --> 00:18:15.805
THERE’S A GOOD CHANCE YOU MIGHT
LOSE YOUR CHARACTER FOREVER.

00:18:15.872 --> 00:18:16.807
Player: DID I HEAR HER RIGHT?

00:18:16.874 --> 00:18:18.011
Player 2: HOW CAN SHE ASK THAT?

00:18:18.078 --> 00:18:18.978
Player 3: HARD PASS.

00:18:19.046 --> 00:18:20.782
Player 4: YEAH,
WHAT’S THE POINT?

00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:22.486
Player 5: WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!

00:18:22.552 --> 00:18:24.790
IF WE HELP
AND LOSE OUR CHARACTERS,

00:18:24.857 --> 00:18:26.661
ARE YOU GONNA
REIMBURSE US FOR ’EM?

00:18:26.728 --> 00:18:28.798
OR IS THIS A TRICK
TO WEAKEN THE TRIBES

00:18:28.865 --> 00:18:29.900

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:38.485
TO BUILD YOUR CHARACTERS UP,

00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:41.724
AND NO AMOUNT OF MONEY
CAN REPLACE THEIR LOSS.

00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:43.661
WE’RE NOT ASKING THIS LIGHTLY.

TO DEAL WITH IT!

SCREW YOUR SOB STORY!
YOU THINK YOU’RE ALL THAT,

JUST ’CAUSE
YOU WERE IN THAT GAME!

00:19:01.863 --> 00:19:04.203
WELL, HERE’S YOUR CHANCE
TO PROVE HOW BAD-ASS YOU ARE!

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.638

ABOUT HIJACKERS
OR A.I.s WITH SOULS?

00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:09.613

INTO OUR GAME
