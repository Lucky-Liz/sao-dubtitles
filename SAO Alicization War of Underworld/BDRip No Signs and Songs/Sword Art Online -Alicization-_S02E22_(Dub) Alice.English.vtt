for taking time

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:07.306
out of your busy schedules
to be here.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.317
Today, the institute
is announcing the birth

00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:15.532
of the world’s first true
artificial general intelligence.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:25.060
I’d like to introduce you to...

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:26.062
Alice.

Alice: People of the real world,
good day to you.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.703
My name is Alice,
Alice Synthesis Thirty.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.008
Alice: My name is Alice,
Alice Synthesis Thirty.

00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:46.385
Ayano: Wow! She’s wearing
our school’s uniform!

00:02:46.418 --> 00:02:48.726
Rika: I heard
she asked for it specifically.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.333
She said she wanted
to wear the same uniform

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:54.175
as the knights who came
to help the Human Guardian Army.

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:55.546
It wasn’t her first choice,
though.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:56.784
She really wanted to wear

00:02:56.817 --> 00:02:59.390
the same gold armor
she had in the Underworld.

00:02:59.423 --> 00:03:01.396
Suguha: I bet Rath
saw how much it’d cost

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.402
to make gold-plated armor
and were like, "Nope."

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:04.371
( all laugh )

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:06.077
Shino: They sure didn’t skimp

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.549
on getting
her looks just right.

00:03:07.582 --> 00:03:10.156
It’s like a one-to-one copy.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.531
Rinko: We’ll take
your questions. Yes?

00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:15.974
Reporter: I’d like to start
with what we’re all wondering.

00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:18.683
How is Miss Alice here different

00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:20.722
from any of the other
programmable robots

00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:22.662
that have been
developed so far?

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:24.465
Rinko: Her brain, actually.

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:26.505
I’m referring to the mind,
not the organ.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.880
Her consciousness,
which is stored

00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:31.486
in the photonic brain
in her skull,

00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:34.162
isn’t a program
made up of binary code.

00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:38.107
Essentially, it functions
the same as a human brain.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.745
That’s what makes her different

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.885
from the robots
we have currently.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.593
Reporter: Perhaps you
could show us what you mean

00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:45.596
with a demonstration.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.901
I’m sure my colleagues here

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:48.973
and the viewers at home
would appreciate it.

00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:51.246
Rinko: If you look
in the handouts we provided,

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:52.885
you’ll find
her Turing test results there.

00:03:52.918 --> 00:03:55.057
Reporter: I was hoping
for something more,

00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:56.495
a visual example,

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:58.133
say, opening her skull
and showing us

00:03:58.167 --> 00:03:59.872
what this photonic brain
looks like.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.845
- Rinko: I--
- Alice: Of course.

00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:02.647
Rinko: Uh...

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.751
Alice: I would not mind.

00:04:03.784 --> 00:04:06.158
But first,
could you please prove to us

00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:07.930
that you are not a robot?

00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:09.736
It is only fair.

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.109
Reporter: Well,
I-I’m obviously human.

00:04:12.142 --> 00:04:13.815
How would I go about proving it?

00:04:13.848 --> 00:04:16.588
Alice: It is simple.
I could open your skull

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:18.862
and show everyone here
your brain.

00:04:18.896 --> 00:04:20.601
( crowd murmurs )

00:04:20.634 --> 00:04:22.105
( Suguha chuckles )

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.609
Alice isn’t messing around.

00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:28.960
Reporter 2: Um, this question
is for Dr. Kojiro.

00:04:28.993 --> 00:04:31.534
Labor unions have raised
the concern before

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:33.975
about the use
of advanced A.I. in industry

00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:36.515
causing unemployment
to rise even further.

00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:38.453
Are those fears unfounded?

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:41.196
Rinko: Let me make
one thing perfectly clear.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.737
Our institute has no intention

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.679
of providing true A.I. for
application in simple labor.

00:04:46.712 --> 00:04:48.685
( reporter 2 gasps )
But the financial sector

00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:50.023
seems to have hopes you will.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.730
In fact, the stocks of
industrial robot manufacturers

00:04:52.765 --> 00:04:54.971
shot up when you
announced this presser.

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:56.810
Rinko: A true A.I.,

00:04:56.843 --> 00:05:00.688
or rather what we like to call
an Artificial Fluctlight,

00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:02.059
is not the sort of thing

00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:04.901
that can be mass-produced
in a short amount of time.

00:05:04.934 --> 00:05:07.943
They’re born as infants
and raised by their families

00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:09.983
from children to adults,
just like us.

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:13.894
They mature and develop
their own unique personalities,

00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:14.998
just like us.

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:16.770
To force
an intelligence like that

00:05:16.804 --> 00:05:19.678
to spend their existence
as a robot in some factory

00:05:19.712 --> 00:05:21.918
is inhumane
and should not be allowed.

00:05:21.951 --> 00:05:26.097
Reporter 2: Doctor, I’m sorry,
but are you saying A.I.s

00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:28.872
should have
the same rights as humans?

00:05:28.906 --> 00:05:31.882
Rinko: At this point in time,
I don’t expect any of you

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.619
to accept
Artificial Fluctlights

00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:35.759
as human beings
with human rights.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:39.003
That’s a topic that requires
a more thorough discussion.

00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:41.812
However, I believe,
in a century or two,

00:05:41.845 --> 00:05:44.017
our society
will advance to the point

00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:46.257
where we’ll be living
with them as equals,

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.802
interacting freely with them,
and accepting them as ordinary.

00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:52.008
We’ll even marry and
start families with them.

00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:55.017
It’s only a matter of time,
really,

00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:57.960
and since a shared future
with them is inevitable,

00:05:57.993 --> 00:06:00.199
it would be immoral
to subject them to slavery.

00:06:00.233 --> 00:06:01.905
Reporter 2:
But they’re not like us!

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:04.813
Their existence is
totally different from ours.

00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:07.857
They’re mechanical,
made by humans in a factory.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.263
How are we supposed
to accept them as equal to us

00:06:10.296 --> 00:06:12.102
when their bodies
aren’t even flesh and blood?

00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:14.308
Rinko: I--Eh?

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.414
Alice: If I may speak frankly.

00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:21.029
I accept you real-world humans
for what you are, my creators,

00:06:21.062 --> 00:06:23.201
and I am grateful
to you for creating me.

00:06:23.235 --> 00:06:26.010
When we learned
of your existence,

00:06:26.043 --> 00:06:29.187
a man from my world
pointed something out,

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.797
"Suppose the real world
also had a creator.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.301
"Who created them?

00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:36.977
And how many more creators
are there behind them?"

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.323
I ask you, if your creator
appeared before you one day

00:06:41.356 --> 00:06:45.669
and made you their slaves,
how would you respond to that?

00:06:45.703 --> 00:06:49.279
Would you grovel,
pledge loyalty, beg for mercy?

Dare I say, I love him.

And the thought of not being
able to see him now,

pains me so.

00:07:22.948 --> 00:07:26.560
It feels like
this metal chest would burst.

I will not,

Newscaster: I have to admit,
I never heard of the Oceanic

Resource Exploration and
Research Institute before today.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.787
Apparently, they were
testing autonomous subs

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.093
on the Ocean Turtle
when the hijacking took place.

00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:02.902
Commentator: Yes. And according
to the latest reports,

00:08:02.935 --> 00:08:04.874
the hijackers were
trying to get their hands

00:08:04.907 --> 00:08:07.048
on this A.I.
we just heard speaking.

00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:08.619
Newscaster: We also just learned

00:08:08.653 --> 00:08:10.925
a J.S.D.F. officer
was killed in the raid.

00:08:12.798 --> 00:08:13.834
( Higa sighs )

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:14.971
Damn it, Keeks.

00:08:15.005 --> 00:08:17.312
I can’t wrap my head
around the fact

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:19.118
that out of all of us,
you were the one

00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:21.591
that had to die.
It ain’t right.

00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:26.005
Kikuoka: I know.
It took me by surprise, too.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:29.181
Oh, well. It’s better this way
than the alternatives.

00:08:29.214 --> 00:08:31.721
They could have either
had me dragged into court

00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:32.925
and turned into a scapegoat,

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:35.967
or they could have
had me disappeared for real.

00:08:36.002 --> 00:08:37.238
But with me dead,

00:08:37.272 --> 00:08:39.946
the public’s attention
is right where we want it to be,

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:41.518
on the bureaucrats
in our government

00:08:41.551 --> 00:08:43.725
trying to sabotage our goals.

00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:45.898
I didn’t think it went
all the way up the ladder

00:08:45.931 --> 00:08:48.038
to the Vice-Minister
of Defense, though.

00:08:48.071 --> 00:08:50.244
That was truly shocking.

00:08:50.277 --> 00:08:51.782
Higa: No, not really.

00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:53.721
Who needs ethics when
the U.S. weapons industry’s

00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:55.627
throwing cash at you?

00:08:55.661 --> 00:08:57.767
Anyway, back to your plan.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.542
Are you sure going public
with the A.I. Fluctlights

00:09:00.576 --> 00:09:01.579
was the right move?

00:09:01.612 --> 00:09:03.584
I mean, by doing this,

00:09:03.617 --> 00:09:05.690
it’s totally screwing
with Rath’s big goal

00:09:05.723 --> 00:09:08.164
to use ’em in weaponized drones.

00:09:08.197 --> 00:09:09.568
Kikuoka: Maybe it does.

00:09:09.602 --> 00:09:11.942
But now the Americans know
we have the capability,

00:09:11.975 --> 00:09:14.182
and that, my friend,
is a good thing.

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:15.988
Now their weapons manufacturers

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.927
can’t force us
to hand over our tech

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.768
under the pretext
of joint development.

00:09:20.802 --> 00:09:22.607
This press conference
tells the world

00:09:22.641 --> 00:09:25.784
we perfected the A.I. Fluctlight
without their help.

00:09:25.817 --> 00:09:27.656
Even if they had
other plans to get it,

00:09:27.689 --> 00:09:30.131
they won’t try
after seeing this.

00:09:30.164 --> 00:09:31.602
Higa: Yeah, I guess not.

00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:34.844
And we have him to thank
for getting us here.

00:09:42.032 --> 00:09:43.837
( sighs )

00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:47.215
Kikuoka: Hey. Higa, look. Look!

00:09:47.248 --> 00:09:48.686
Higa: What? What is it?

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:51.160
Isn’t the press conference
over by now?

00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:53.834
( monitor buzzes )

00:09:55.205 --> 00:09:56.943

00:09:56.976 --> 00:09:59.752
Rinko: Ultimately,
our hope is that you’ll meet

00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:02.227
Artificial Fluctlights
in the virtual world

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.731
to experience who they are,

00:10:03.764 --> 00:10:06.806
and then perhaps
you’ll change your mind.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.184
That’s all we ask of anyone
watching this broadcast today.

00:10:10.217 --> 00:10:12.256
Go and see for yourself.

00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:13.427
Reporter 3: Uh, Doctor!

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.600
That all sounds nice,

00:10:15.633 --> 00:10:17.973
but have you considered
all the possibilities?

00:10:18.007 --> 00:10:19.812
What if they decide to,
I don’t know,

00:10:19.845 --> 00:10:22.020
rise up and take us over?

00:10:22.053 --> 00:10:24.360
Rinko: We have considered
that possibility,

00:10:24.393 --> 00:10:25.395
but it’s a stretch.

Rinko: That could only happen

00:10:28.872 --> 00:10:32.150
if, say, we tried to exterminate
their kind first.

00:10:32.183 --> 00:10:33.921
Reporter 3: Okay,
but when you think

00:10:33.954 --> 00:10:35.794
of all the movies
and books up to now--

00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:36.829
Alice: Please excuse me.

00:10:36.863 --> 00:10:37.900

00:10:37.933 --> 00:10:39.370

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.433

Kazuto: Listen.

00:11:15.847 --> 00:11:17.953
It’s about your little sister.

00:11:17.987 --> 00:11:19.659
She went into Deep Freeze,

00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:21.932
’cause she wanted
to wait for you.

00:11:21.965 --> 00:11:23.871
She’s up on the 80th floor

from my memory,

the max-accel phase kicked in.

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.876
Me and Her Highness
are done there.

Sorry I’m so late.

Are you eating enough?

Remember, I’ve been
stuck in bed for two months.

00:12:39.036 --> 00:12:41.142
Anyway, you know when
they’re letting me out of here?

Three days from now.

Asuna: Really?

00:12:44.252 --> 00:12:47.193
Then we should celebrate
with a party or two!

00:12:47.227 --> 00:12:50.603
We can have one in A.L.O.
and in real life!

Kazuto: Nurse Aki
just told me about that,

so either you have my room
bugged, or you’re psychic.

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:07.200
I don’t wanna know, either way.

00:14:07.234 --> 00:14:08.405

what are you going to do?

Are you going to retire now?

00:14:21.209 --> 00:14:23.651
We heard about
what happened at Rath,

00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:25.790
about how they
put Rinko in charge.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:28.431
You can’t go
to the Roppongi office anymore.

00:14:28.465 --> 00:14:29.936
Kikuoka: Don’t worry about me.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.945
I’m still around,
just working in the background.

00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:35.018
I have enough
on my plate as it is

00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:37.860
trying to keep the Ocean Turtle
and the Underworld safe.

00:14:37.894 --> 00:14:39.431
Kazuto: You are? That’s great!

00:14:39.464 --> 00:14:42.875
So do you know what’ll
happen to the Underworld now?

00:14:42.908 --> 00:14:44.078
Kikuoka: At the moment,

00:14:44.112 --> 00:14:46.151
things aren’t looking
that good for it.

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:49.762
The government still hasn’t
picked a scapegoat to save face.

00:14:49.796 --> 00:14:51.869
It’s only
a matter of time, though.

00:14:51.902 --> 00:14:54.376
They’ve been itching
to dismantle Rath,

00:14:54.409 --> 00:14:56.114
and when they do, all our tech

00:14:56.147 --> 00:14:59.358
will get divvied up
by the major conglomerates.

00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:00.862
They’ll seize Alice.

00:15:00.896 --> 00:15:03.135
Then they’ll
probably reinitialize

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:04.941
the Lightcube Cluster
on the Turtle.

00:15:04.975 --> 00:15:06.847
Asuna: But they can’t!

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.320
Kazuto: You’re not gonna
let that happen, are you?

00:15:09.353 --> 00:15:11.259
You got a plan, right?

00:15:11.292 --> 00:15:12.832
Kikuoka: A plan?

00:15:12.865 --> 00:15:13.968
Not really.

00:15:14.002 --> 00:15:15.740
It’s more like a hope.

00:15:15.773 --> 00:15:17.445
While the government’s
running around,

00:15:17.478 --> 00:15:19.418
trying to save their asses,

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:21.892
I’m hoping the public
will come to acknowledge

00:15:21.925 --> 00:15:25.101
the human rights
of the Artificial Fluctlights.

00:15:25.134 --> 00:15:26.974
And the way to achieve that

00:15:27.007 --> 00:15:30.049
is to get as many people
from the real world as possible

00:15:30.082 --> 00:15:33.895
to have as much contact with
the Underworlders as they can.

00:15:33.928 --> 00:15:35.164
Sounds like the kind of thing

00:15:35.198 --> 00:15:37.439
the Seed Nexus is for,
doesn’t it?

00:15:37.472 --> 00:15:39.612
Kazuto: Yeah, I guess.

00:15:39.646 --> 00:15:42.052
Kikuoka: The problem
is the Underworld

00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:44.961
needs a high-bandwidth
connection to the Seed Nexus,

00:15:44.994 --> 00:15:48.303
and the bigger the bandwidth,
the better the access.

00:15:48.337 --> 00:15:51.079
Right now, the Underworld’s
cut off from everything.

00:15:51.112 --> 00:15:54.221
The government shut down
the Turtle’s SAT-link.

00:15:54.255 --> 00:15:58.033
Restoring that connection is
next on my to-do list, in fact.

00:15:58.066 --> 00:15:59.572
That press conference
the other day

00:15:59.605 --> 00:16:01.376
was a step toward that.

00:16:01.409 --> 00:16:05.523
It bought us attention
and, even better, time.

00:16:05.556 --> 00:16:07.293
Kazuto: The connection.

00:16:08.397 --> 00:16:09.869
( grunts )

00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:12.308
Kikuoka...

00:16:13.614 --> 00:16:14.584
please...

00:16:14.618 --> 00:16:17.257
don’t let it die.

00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:19.062
Please save it.

00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:23.041
Kikuoka: You don’t
have to beg me.

00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:26.351
After all, the Underworld

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:29.426
is the one dream
I’d risk my life for, too.

of me and Keeks did.

00:16:49.526 --> 00:16:50.931
Hmm.

00:16:50.965 --> 00:16:52.635
Once it finds out it’s a copy,

00:16:52.668 --> 00:16:56.180
there’s no way a human soul
saved on a Lightcube

00:16:56.213 --> 00:16:57.752
can survive the strain,

00:16:57.785 --> 00:17:01.528

Higa: Uh, yeah.

00:17:52.985 --> 00:17:54.957
I only had time for yours.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.796
During
the memory-delete process,

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.102
Keeks and Rinko
were doing other things,

00:17:59.136 --> 00:18:02.247
so I went ahead and copied you.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.316
Kirito: I see.

00:18:07.395 --> 00:18:11.708
The queen--that is, Asuna--

00:18:11.741 --> 00:18:14.950
she and I talked about
the possibility of this.

00:18:14.983 --> 00:18:19.999
She said that if she were
the only one who got copied,

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:22.974
she would have herself
deleted right away

00:18:23.008 --> 00:18:24.980
and if we both got copied,

00:18:25.014 --> 00:18:26.887
we’d use whatever time
we had left

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.162
to unite the real world
and the Underworld.

00:18:30.195 --> 00:18:33.607
Higa: What about
if only you were copied?

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.313
Did you talk about that?

00:18:35.346 --> 00:18:38.522
Kirito: Yeah.
We decided if that happened,

00:18:38.555 --> 00:18:39.792
I’d protect the Underworld

00:18:39.825 --> 00:18:43.336
and fight only for it
if it came to that.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.113
Higa: What do you mean, "fight"?

00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:48.985
Kirito: The Underworld’s fate

00:18:49.018 --> 00:18:52.631
is extremely unstable
over there, isn’t it?

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:55.037
Higa: Yeah, it is.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.211
Kirito: The Underworld
is powerless,

00:18:57.244 --> 00:18:59.149
compared to the real world.

00:18:59.182 --> 00:19:01.958
It relies on a power source,
hardware,

00:19:01.991 --> 00:19:05.100
maintenance, and a network.

00:19:05.133 --> 00:19:07.675
Its existence depends
on real-world people

00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:09.381
to keep the infrastructure
running.

00:19:09.415 --> 00:19:13.427
Its safety in the long term
is precarious at best.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.003
Higa: You’re right, but there’s
just no getting around that.

00:19:17.036 --> 00:19:19.979
The Lightcube Cluster,
that is the Underworld,

00:19:20.012 --> 00:19:22.319
and it can’t be moved
off the Ocean Turtle.

00:19:22.354 --> 00:19:25.729
Besides, the government’s
got control of the Turtle now.

00:19:25.763 --> 00:19:29.072
If they wanted to, they could
cut the power tomorrow,

00:19:29.105 --> 00:19:32.315
reinitialize the cluster,
and wipe it clean.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.756
Kirito: How long
will the reactor’s fuel last?

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.762
Higa: Um, I guess...

00:19:36.796 --> 00:19:40.407
since it’s a pressurized
water reactor from a sub...

00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:42.078
and it’s just powering
the cluster,

00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:43.550
then four or five years?

00:19:43.584 --> 00:19:46.359
Kirito: Then there’s no need
to refuel during that time,

00:19:46.392 --> 00:19:49.435
and as long as we prevent
outside interference,

00:19:49.468 --> 00:19:53.111
the Underworld will continue to
exist for that length of time.

00:19:53.144 --> 00:19:54.315
Do you agree?

00:19:54.349 --> 00:19:57.023
Higa: Y-Yeah,
but h-hold on a sec!

00:19:57.056 --> 00:19:59.029
There’s no weapons system
on the Turtle,

00:19:59.062 --> 00:20:00.065
and without weapons, we can’t--

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:02.574
Kirito: I said I would fight.

00:20:02.607 --> 00:20:06.619
Higa: But how? There’s no way
to connect to the Turtle

00:20:06.653 --> 00:20:08.156
or the cluster now.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.330
The satellite link’s
been cut off.

00:20:10.363 --> 00:20:13.440
Kirito: There’s another link.
We use that.

00:20:13.473 --> 00:20:14.609
Higa: What link?

00:20:14.643 --> 00:20:16.482
Kirito: It’s Heathcliff,

00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:18.688
Akihiko Kayaba.

00:20:18.722 --> 00:20:20.394
We need to find him right away.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:24.271
You will help find him,
won’t you?

00:20:24.305 --> 00:20:26.277
Higa: H-He’s still alive?

00:20:27.415 --> 00:20:29.253
Kayaba?

00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:35.539
A copy of Akihiko Kayaba
and Kazuto Kirigaya,

00:20:35.572 --> 00:20:37.377
what would happen
if those copies--

00:20:37.412 --> 00:20:40.319
I mean, people,
came into contact?

00:20:41.524 --> 00:20:43.262
Oh, my God.

00:20:43.295 --> 00:20:46.270
I think I might have opened
Pandora’s box here.

00:20:47.876 --> 00:20:50.784
But I wanna see that.

00:20:50.818 --> 00:20:53.225
I have to know what’ll happen.

00:20:53.258 --> 00:20:55.364
All right, you’re on.

00:20:55.398 --> 00:20:56.602
I’ve got some old contacts.

00:20:56.636 --> 00:20:59.844
I’ll send a few emails,
encrypted of course.

I was walking through a forest.

Eugeo was chopping at a tree.

00:22:48.972 --> 00:22:52.516
He was a woodcutter
in the Underworld.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.659
His job was to cut down
this big cedar,

00:22:55.692 --> 00:22:59.938
a tree that, for 300 years,
couldn’t be cut down by anyone.
