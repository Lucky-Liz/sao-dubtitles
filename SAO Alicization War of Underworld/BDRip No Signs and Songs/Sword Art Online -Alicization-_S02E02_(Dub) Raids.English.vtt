ABOUT HOW LONG
WILL THE BULKHEADS HOLD?

Nakanishi: DEPENDS.
IF THEY HAVE SAWS, EIGHT HOURS.

00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:54.050
A FEW MINUTES
IF THEY HAVE EXPLOSIVES,

00:13:54.116 --> 00:13:55.419
BUT THEY WON’T GO WITH THAT,

00:13:55.486 --> 00:13:57.656
NOT ON THE PRIMARY BULKHEAD.

00:13:57.722 --> 00:14:01.464

PLEASE TELL ME EVERYONE’S OKAY.

THREE CIVVIES
WITH THE RESEARCH TEAM

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.155
SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES.

00:14:13.221 --> 00:14:15.392
AS FOR OUR S.D.F. UNIT,

00:14:15.458 --> 00:14:17.963
IT SUFFERED TWO MINOR
AND TWO HEAVY INJURIES.

00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:19.467
IT’S NOTHING LIFE-THREATENING.

00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:20.535
THEY’RE BEING TREATED NOW.

00:14:22.606 --> 00:14:23.975
Nakanishi: NOT SO GOOD, SIR.

00:14:24.043 --> 00:14:26.447
THE BULKHEADS FROM
THE BILGE DOCK TO MAIN CONTROL

00:14:26.514 --> 00:14:29.887
ARE OFFLINE
AND CAN’T BE ACCESSED REMOTELY.

00:14:29.954 --> 00:14:31.757
BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS POWER.

00:14:31.824 --> 00:14:34.730
THE MAIN LINE WAS CUT,
SO WE’RE ON AUXILIARY NOW.

00:14:34.797 --> 00:14:36.834
THE GOOD NEWS
IS WE HAVE STABLE POWER

00:14:36.901 --> 00:14:38.037
ALL THROUGH THE SHIP.

00:14:38.104 --> 00:14:40.475
THE BAD NEWS IS
WE CAN’T ROTATE THE SCREW PROPS

00:14:40.542 --> 00:14:42.546
WITHOUT REBOOTING
THE WHOLE SYSTEM.

00:14:42.613 --> 00:14:46.253

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.524
AND WITH A SHARK
NIPPING AT ITS BELLY.

00:14:48.591 --> 00:14:51.331
Nakanishi: YES.
THEY GOT THE BILGE DOCK

00:14:51.398 --> 00:14:53.835
AND ALL 12 SECTORS
IN THE LOWER SHAFT.

00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:55.939
( sighs ) THE BASTARDS.

00:14:56.007 --> 00:14:57.509
THEY GOT US GOOD.

00:14:57.576 --> 00:14:58.845
Kikuoka: THEY DID.

00:14:58.912 --> 00:15:02.119
ALL RIGHT,
THEY HAVE MAIN CONTROL,

00:15:02.186 --> 00:15:05.292
S.T.L. ONE,
AND THE NUCLEAR REACTOR.

00:15:05.358 --> 00:15:08.731
THEY DON’T WANT TO DESTROY US.
IF THEY DID,

00:15:08.798 --> 00:15:11.004
THEY WOULD’VE BLOWN US
OUT OF THE WATER BY NOW.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.141
THE NEXT QUESTION IS...

00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:15.578
WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE?

00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:18.184
HIGA, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.922

AND THE HARDWARE
THEY’RE PACKING,

00:15:28.205 --> 00:15:30.342
I’D SAY THEY WERE MERCS.

00:15:30.409 --> 00:15:32.480
AND, BASED ON
THEIR AVERAGE SIZE,

00:15:32.546 --> 00:15:34.416
I’M PRETTY SURE
THEY’RE NOT ASIAN.

00:15:34.483 --> 00:15:36.487
Kikuoka: WELL,
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

00:15:36.553 --> 00:15:37.656
AT LEAST
WE’RE NOT BEING ATTACKED

00:15:37.723 --> 00:15:39.960
BY OUR OWN SPECIAL FORCES,

00:15:40.028 --> 00:15:41.430
WHICH IS A RELIEF.

00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:45.205
WE CAN ALSO BE SURE
OF ONE OTHER THING.

00:15:45.271 --> 00:15:47.409
WHOEVER THESE PEOPLE ARE,

00:15:47.476 --> 00:15:50.148
THEY KNOW ABOUT
PROJECT ALICIZATION.

Higa: YUP, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:53.988
THEY BROKE IN
THROUGH THE BILGE DECK

00:15:54.056 --> 00:15:56.560
AND HEADED STRAIGHT
FOR THE MAIN CONTROL ROOM.

00:15:56.627 --> 00:15:58.564
THEY KNOW ABOUT THE S.T.L.,

00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:01.503

WE HAVE A TRUE BOTTOM-UP A.I.

I LOCKED MAIN CON DOWN IN TIME.

( chuckles ) I FIXED IT

00:16:11.858 --> 00:16:14.162
SO THEY CAN’T INTERFERE
WITH THE SIMULATION

00:16:14.229 --> 00:16:17.136

FROM THE LIGHTCUBE CLUSTER.

BUT, THEN, NEITHER CAN WE.

00:16:20.575 --> 00:16:22.012
Higa: NO, WE CAN’T.

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:24.717
NO ONE CAN EJECT
ALICE’S LIGHTCUBE EXTERNALLY,

OR US IN HERE.

I MEAN, IT’S PRETTY MUCH
A WIN FOR OUR SIDE.

00:16:31.597 --> 00:16:34.337
THEY CAN’T ACCESS THE CLUSTER
BY COMPUTER,

00:16:34.403 --> 00:16:35.706

BREAK THROUGH THE WALL,

’TIL THE "ASAHI"
COMES WITH BACKUP.

GAME OVER!

00:16:45.925 --> 00:16:48.832

SINCE THEY HAVE
CONTROL OF S.T.L. ONE,

00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:38.164

AND THAT’S NOT SOMETHING
CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT CAN HELP.

00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:43.528
WE THOUGHT THE S.T.L.

00:18:43.594 --> 00:18:45.832
COULD STIMULATE
THE GROWTH OF A NEW NETWORK,

00:18:45.899 --> 00:18:49.172
SO WE BLOCKED HIS MEMORY AND
DROPPED HIM INTO THE UNDERWORLD.

00:18:49.239 --> 00:18:53.414
BUT, THIS TIME,
HIS MEMORY DIDN’T GET BLOCKED,

IT’S ACCELERATED

00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:26.080
IN THE CENTRAL CATHEDRAL,

00:19:26.146 --> 00:19:29.653
SINCE THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO GET AHOLD OF US.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.657
OR RATHER KEEKS HERE.

00:19:31.724 --> 00:19:33.527
I BET HE WAS GONNA
TRY TO CONVINCE YOU

00:19:33.594 --> 00:19:35.865
TO SPARE THEM AND THEIR WORLD.

00:19:35.932 --> 00:19:38.838
HE HAD TO FIGHT LIKE HELL
TO GET TO THAT CONSOLE,

00:19:38.905 --> 00:19:42.045
BUT HE MADE IT,
THANKS TO SOME FRIENDS.

00:19:42.112 --> 00:19:45.185
I COULDN’T CHECK THE EVENT LOG
DURING ALL THE COMMOTION HERE,

00:19:45.252 --> 00:19:46.086
BUT HIS FRIENDS HELPED HIM

00:19:46.153 --> 00:19:48.658
IN THE FIGHT
WITH THE AXIOM CHURCH.

00:19:48.724 --> 00:19:50.828
SOME DIDN’T MAKE IT.

00:19:50.895 --> 00:19:53.835
WHEN HE GOT THROUGH TO US,
HE WAS IN MENTAL DISTRESS,

00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:56.940
BLAMING HIMSELF
FOR THE DEATH OF HIS FRIENDS.

00:19:57.008 --> 00:20:01.850
AND, BY DOING THAT, HE ENDED UP
ATTACKING HIS OWN FLUCTLIGHT.

00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:04.723
IT WAS RIGHT ABOUT THEN
WHEN THOSE JACKASSES

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.262
CUT THE POWER LINE.
THAT CAUSED A SHORT CIRCUIT,

00:20:07.329 --> 00:20:11.069
AND THE SURGE FROM THAT CAUSED
A SPIKE IN THE S.T.L.’s OUTPUT.

00:20:11.136 --> 00:20:12.739
AS A RESULT,

00:20:12.806 --> 00:20:16.947
KIRITO’S SELF-DESTRUCTIVE
IMPULSE WAS ACTUALIZED.

00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:21.223
THEN HIS EGO WAS DEACTIVATED.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.158
Rinko: I DON’T GET IT.

00:20:22.225 --> 00:20:24.663
HIS EGO WAS DEACTIVATED?

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.834
I DIDN’T KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.905
Higa: HAVE A LOOK AT THE SCREEN.

00:20:28.971 --> 00:20:30.474
THAT’S A FLUCTLIGHT,

00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:32.479
KIRITO’S FLUCTLIGHT
TO BE PRECISE.

00:20:32.546 --> 00:20:34.883
AND THAT BLACK HOLE
RIGHT THERE...

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.222
IS WHERE A PERSON’S SELF-IMAGE
SHOULD BE.

00:20:37.289 --> 00:20:38.991
Rinko: THE SELF-IMAGE,

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:42.733
THE IDEA, CONCEPT,
OR MENTAL IMAGE OF ONESELF.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.038
Higa: YUP.
ALL OF YOUR DECISION MAKING

00:20:45.104 --> 00:20:48.511
PASSES THROUGH A SIMPLE YES-NO
PATHWAY IN YOUR FLUCTLIGHT.

00:20:48.577 --> 00:20:51.183
IT ASKS WHETHER YOU SHOULD
OR SHOULDN’T DO SOMETHING

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.189
BASED ON
WHATEVER SITUATION YOU’RE IN.

00:20:54.256 --> 00:20:55.825
FOR EXAMPLE, DR. KOJIRO,

00:20:55.892 --> 00:20:57.796
WHEN YOU’RE
AT YOUR FAVE BEEF-BOWL PLACE,

00:20:57.862 --> 00:20:59.600
YOU EVER ORDER A SECOND HELPING?

00:20:59.666 --> 00:21:01.170
Rinko: MM, NO.

00:21:01.237 --> 00:21:03.073
Higa: EVEN IF IN YOUR MIND,
YOU’RE LIKE,

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.145
"DAMN, THIS IS GOOD.
I COULD EAT ANOTHER BOWL"?

00:21:05.211 --> 00:21:06.981
Rinko: NEVER.

00:21:07.048 --> 00:21:09.486
Higa: AND THAT’S
YOUR SELF-IMAGE PATHWAY AT WORK.

00:21:09.553 --> 00:21:10.889
DECISIONS
CAN’T LEAD TO ACTIONS

00:21:10.956 --> 00:21:12.926
UNLESS THEY GO
THROUGH THOSE CIRCUITS.

00:21:12.993 --> 00:21:16.900
IN KIRITO’S CASE, HIS FLUCTLIGHT
IS DAMAGED IN THAT ONE SPOT.

00:21:16.967 --> 00:21:19.105
HE CAN’T PROCESS
WHAT HAPPENS AROUND HIM,

00:21:19.172 --> 00:21:20.975
AND HE CAN’T INITIATE AN ACTION.

00:21:21.043 --> 00:21:24.883
ALL HE CAN DO, I THINK, IS STUFF
HE REMEMBERS FROM REPETITION--

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.188
EATING, SLEEPING,
STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.964
RIGHT NOW, I DON’T THINK
HE KNOWS WHO HE IS

00:21:32.032 --> 00:21:33.734
OR WHAT HE SHOULD DO,

00:21:33.801 --> 00:21:36.541
AND HE CAN’T SPEAK,
SO HE CAN’T ASK FOR HELP.

00:21:36.607 --> 00:21:37.876
BUT THAT’S JUST MY THEORY.

00:21:37.943 --> 00:21:39.079
( Asuna sighs )

00:23:19.285 --> 00:23:21.122
( typing )

00:23:23.693 --> 00:23:24.795
( man chuckles )

00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:25.997
( whistles )

00:23:34.949 --> 00:23:36.185
( man 2 chuckles )
