00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.826
Asuna: NO, NOT AT ALL.

00:10:22.893 --> 00:10:26.300
MY GROUP AND I, WE WANT
TO PROTECT THE UNDERWORLD.

00:10:26.367 --> 00:10:28.104
THE PEOPLE
WE’RE FIGHTING AGAINST

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.773
DON’T CARE ABOUT THIS PLACE.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.212
THEY JUST WANT
ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE,

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:33.981
AND WHEN THEY FIND THEM,
THEY’LL CAPTURE THEM

00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:37.556
AND BRING THEM INTO OUR WORLD,
THEN DESTROY YOURS.

00:10:37.623 --> 00:10:38.925
Golgorosso:
THAT’S MONSTROUS.

00:10:38.992 --> 00:10:40.329
Captain: I DON’T BELIEVE THIS.

00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:42.566
Captain 2: HOW DO WE KNOW
SHE SPEAKS THE TRUTH?

00:10:42.633 --> 00:10:44.703
Bercouli: ’CAUSE IT’S POSSIBLE.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.810
THE DARK TERRITORY
SURROUNDS THE HUMAN EMPIRE.

00:10:47.877 --> 00:10:50.815
IT’S BASICALLY A WHOLE
’NOTHER WORLD FROM OURS,

00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:54.223
A PLACE WITH FOLKS WHO JUST
WANNA INVADE AND DESTROY US.

00:10:54.289 --> 00:10:56.727
FEW OF US HAVE EVER SEEN IT
OR BEEN TO IT,

00:10:56.794 --> 00:10:59.065
BUT IT’S AS REAL
AS OUR SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS.

00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:02.206
AND NOW WE FIND OUT
THERE’S ANOTHER WORLD OUT THERE.

00:11:02.273 --> 00:11:04.710
I SAY SURE, WHY NOT?

00:11:04.777 --> 00:11:07.282
YOU SAID
THESE FOLKS YOU’RE FIGHTING

00:11:07.349 --> 00:11:09.420
ARE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE SPECIFIC.

00:11:09.487 --> 00:11:11.055
YOU GOT ANY IDEA
WHO THAT COULD BE?

00:11:12.157 --> 00:11:14.095
( Asuna grunts )

00:11:14.162 --> 00:11:15.265
( Alice gasps )

00:11:15.332 --> 00:11:17.503
UH, I AM THE ONE?!

00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:19.707
- ( captains murmuring )
- Bercouli: SO THAT’S WHAT

00:11:19.773 --> 00:11:21.777
THIS "PRIESTESS OF LIGHT"
STUFF’S ABOUT.

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:25.919
LOOK, THERE ISN’T
MUCH TIME LEFT.

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:28.424
THERE’S ONLY ONE WAY
TO KEEP THE UNDERWORLD SAFE,

00:11:28.491 --> 00:11:29.827
AND THAT’S FOR ALICE TO RETURN

00:11:29.894 --> 00:11:32.767
TO THE REAL WORLD WITH ME
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:35.003
ONCE THE ENEMY
FINDS OUT SHE’S NOT HERE,

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.309
THEY’LL GIVE UP
AND LEAVE YOUR WORLD ALONE.

00:11:37.376 --> 00:11:39.880
Alice: Y-YOU MUST BE JOKING!

00:11:39.947 --> 00:11:42.987
YOU WANT ME TO RUN AWAY
TO YOUR SO-CALLED "REAL WORLD,"

00:11:43.053 --> 00:11:46.227
TO ABANDON MY PEOPLE
WHEN THEY NEED ME THE MOST?

00:11:46.294 --> 00:11:49.099
I WOULD NEVER!
I AM AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT!

00:11:49.165 --> 00:11:52.706
MY ONE AND ONLY DUTY
IS TO PROTECT THE HUMAN EMPIRE!

00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:54.309
Asuna: AND YOU’D BE DOING THAT.

00:11:54.376 --> 00:11:57.616
I’M SORRY.
I WISH THERE WERE ANOTHER WAY,

00:11:57.682 --> 00:12:00.255
BUT IF THE ENEMY
FROM THE REAL WORLD FINDS YOU,

00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:02.359
THEY’LL TAKE YOU,
AND THEN EVERYTHING HERE,

00:12:02.426 --> 00:12:04.596
THE PEOPLE, THE LAND, THE SKY,

00:12:04.663 --> 00:12:06.868
EVERYTHING,
THEY WILL ERASE IT ALL!

00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:10.107
WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW,
BEFORE THEY FIND YOU!

00:12:10.174 --> 00:12:12.613
Bercouli: HOLD ON THERE!
IT SEEMS YOUR INFORMATION’S

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.683
A BIT OUT OF DATE, LITTLE LADY.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.687
THE ENEMY FROM YOUR WORLD,

00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:18.825
YEAH, THEY ALREADY FOUND HER.

00:12:18.892 --> 00:12:19.826
( Asuna gasps )

00:12:20.929 --> 00:12:21.831
( Bercouli sighs )

00:12:21.898 --> 00:12:24.570
EVERYTHING MAKES
A LOT MORE SENSE NOW.

00:12:24.637 --> 00:12:27.876
IT ALL FITS. THE PRIESTESS
OF LIGHT AND THE DARK GOD VECTA.

00:12:27.942 --> 00:12:30.916
THAT’S WHY HE SUDDENLY
SHOWED UP TO LEAD HIS ARMY,

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:32.552
BUT HE’S NOT A DARK GOD.

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:35.090
HE CAME FROM THE REAL WORLD,
JUST LIKE YOU.

00:12:35.157 --> 00:12:37.663
Asuna: DARK GOD VECTA?

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.637
THEN THE DARK TERRITORY
HAS SUPERUSER ACCOUNTS,

00:12:41.704 --> 00:12:43.441
AND THEY’RE NOT LOCKED.

00:12:43.507 --> 00:12:47.215
Renly: UM,
M-MAY I ASK SOMETHING?

00:12:47.282 --> 00:12:49.353
REGARDING
THIS PRIESTESS OF LIGHT,

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:50.789
I HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF HER BEFORE.

00:12:50.856 --> 00:12:54.496
SO WHY DO THESE INVADERS
FROM THE REAL WORLD

00:12:54.563 --> 00:12:57.570
WANT ALICE,
OF ALL PEOPLE, SO BADLY?

00:12:57.636 --> 00:12:59.906
Sheyta: SHE BROKE THE SEAL
IN HER RIGHT EYE.

00:12:59.973 --> 00:13:02.612
Alice: Y-YOU KNOW
OF WHAT HAPPENED?

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:04.817
AND THE SEAL? BUT HOW?

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:06.821
Sheyta: THE CENTRAL CATHEDRAL
IS INDESTRUCTIBLE,

00:13:06.888 --> 00:13:09.694
MADE OF
THE HARDEST MATERIAL HERE.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.198
I THINK HOW FUN IT WOULD BE
TO SLICE THROUGH IT.

00:13:12.266 --> 00:13:13.601
THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.006
I FEEL A HORRIBLE PAIN
IN MY RIGHT EYE.

00:13:16.073 --> 00:13:17.209
( captains stammer )

00:13:17.276 --> 00:13:19.580
( Bercouli chuckles ) I WONDER,

00:13:19.647 --> 00:13:22.286
HOW MANY OF US HERE EXPERIENCED
THE SAME THING AS HER?

00:13:22.353 --> 00:13:26.460
I’M SURE AT SOME POINT YOU ALL
HAD DOUBTS ABOUT THE PONTIFEX

00:13:26.527 --> 00:13:28.698
OR SOME OF THE CHURCH’S LAWS.

00:13:28.765 --> 00:13:31.637
YOU SAW FLASHES OF RED LIGHT
IN YOUR RIGHT EYE,

00:13:31.704 --> 00:13:33.808
AND THEN YOU FELT THE PAIN.

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:35.845
IT HURT SO BAD,
IT MADE YOU FORGET

00:13:35.912 --> 00:13:37.949
WHAT YOU WERE THINKIN’ ABOUT,
DIDN’T IT?

00:13:38.016 --> 00:13:39.085
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.290
IF YOU KEEP THINKING
THOSE BLASPHEMOUS THOUGHTS?

00:13:41.357 --> 00:13:45.398
THE PAIN GETS WORSE AND WORSE
UNTIL IT’S SEARING YOUR BRAIN.

00:13:45.465 --> 00:13:47.101
AND THEN...

00:13:47.168 --> 00:13:48.271
Alice: YOUR VISION TURNS RED,

00:13:48.338 --> 00:13:50.241
AND YOUR RIGHT EYE EXPLODES.

00:13:50.308 --> 00:13:51.377
( all gasping )

00:13:51.444 --> 00:13:52.946
Renly: THEN DID YOUR EYE...

00:13:53.012 --> 00:13:54.950
Alice: MM-HMM.

00:13:55.017 --> 00:13:57.822
TO PUT A STOP
TO ADMINISTRATOR’S RULE,

00:13:57.889 --> 00:14:00.996
I KNEW I WOULD BE CONFRONTING
CHUDELKIN AS WELL AS HER.

00:14:01.063 --> 00:14:05.906
TO MUSTER THE RESOLVE TO DO SO,
I HAD TO LOSE MY EYE. ( gasps )

00:14:05.973 --> 00:14:07.475
COME TO THINK OF IT,

00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:10.314
I RECALL ADMINISTRATOR
SAYING SOMETHING,

00:14:10.381 --> 00:14:12.252
SOMETHING ABOUT
THE SEAL OF THE EYE.

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:15.692
I BELIEVE SHE SAID, "CODE...

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:18.265
THAT’S IT! CODE 8-7-1!

00:14:18.331 --> 00:14:19.900
SHE LOOKED RIGHT AT ME,

00:14:19.966 --> 00:14:22.806
AND THAT IS WHAT SHE CALLED
THE SEAL OF THE RIGHT EYE.

00:14:22.873 --> 00:14:25.646
I BELIEVE SHE ALSO SAID
IT WAS INSTALLED.

00:14:25.712 --> 00:14:27.949
I DID NOT KNOW
WHAT SHE MEANT AT THE TIME,

00:14:28.016 --> 00:14:32.225
BUT COULD THIS CODE 8-7-1 SEAL
BE A PRODUCT OF THE REAL WORLD?

00:14:32.292 --> 00:14:35.365
Asuna: A SEAL, 8-7-1.

00:14:35.432 --> 00:14:36.967
IT MUST BE AN INHIBITOR.

00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:38.938
BUT WHY WOULD RATH
INSTALL THAT IN THEM?

00:14:39.005 --> 00:14:41.276
IN THE END,
IT WOULD JUST GET IN THE WAY.

00:14:44.282 --> 00:14:48.592
RATH’S ULTIMATE GOAL WAS TO MAKE
AN A.I. WITH TRUE INTELLIGENCE.

00:14:48.658 --> 00:14:51.263
THE UNDERWORLD WAS CREATED
FOR THAT PURPOSE,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.666
AND THAT’S WHY KIKUOKA AND HIGA

00:14:52.733 --> 00:14:55.572
LET IT EVOLVE
FOR CENTURIES INTERNALLY.

00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:57.676
IF THE WHOLE POINT
OF THIS SIMULATION,

00:14:57.743 --> 00:14:58.911
WAS TO GIVE THE A.I.s

00:14:58.978 --> 00:15:01.182
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DEMONSTRATE FREE WILL,

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.088
FORCING THEM INTO OBEDIENCE
WITH AN INHIBITOR

00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:06.159
DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.

00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:07.329
UNLESS...

00:15:07.396 --> 00:15:10.368
THE SEAL IS A KIND OF SABOTAGE.

00:15:10.435 --> 00:15:13.474
ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE OCEAN
TURTLE’S MAIN CON BEHIND THIS?

00:15:13.541 --> 00:15:16.481
NO, THE SABOTEUR
MUST BE SOMEONE WITH RATH.

00:15:16.547 --> 00:15:19.052
THEY COULD BE WITH US IN SUBCON.

00:15:19.118 --> 00:15:22.292
I HAVE TO TELL KIKUOKA,
BUT THERE’S NO TERMINAL HERE.

00:15:22.359 --> 00:15:25.632
I COULD SUICIDE OUT,
BUT I NEED ALICE TO SAVE KIRITO!

00:15:25.698 --> 00:15:26.900
WHAT DO I DO?

00:15:30.275 --> 00:15:31.944
Kirito: YOU KNOW...

00:15:32.011 --> 00:15:33.948
WHAT TO DO.

00:15:34.015 --> 00:15:35.852
( Asuna gasps )

00:15:35.918 --> 00:15:36.754
( sighs )

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.358
Alice:
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU?

00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:40.261
Asuna: NO. I’M FINE.

00:15:40.328 --> 00:15:42.131
ALICE IS RIGHT.

00:15:42.198 --> 00:15:45.305
THAT CODE 8-7-1 SEAL
WAS PUT THERE BY SOMEONE,

00:15:45.372 --> 00:15:46.941
SOMEONE FROM MY WORLD,

00:15:47.008 --> 00:15:48.411
AND THEY’RE
ON THE ENEMY’S SIDE.

00:15:48.477 --> 00:15:49.746
Bercouli: HMM.

00:15:49.813 --> 00:15:51.850
HOW DO WE GET RID OF THE SEAL?

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:54.356
IS THERE A WAY TO DO IT WITHOUT
BLOWING OUT SOMEONE’S EYEBALL?

00:15:54.423 --> 00:15:57.028
Asuna: I’M SORRY,
BUT I DON’T KNOW OF ANOTHER WAY

00:15:57.094 --> 00:15:59.332
TO DISABLE IT
FROM INSIDE THE UNDERWORLD.

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:01.503
( Bercouli sighs ) ALL RIGHT.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.574
BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS ENEMY,

00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:05.845
THEY ONLY WANT SOMEONE
WHO’S GOT THE WILLPOWER

00:16:05.912 --> 00:16:09.051
TO BREAK THE SEAL
OF THE RIGHT EYE. WHY ONE OF US?

00:16:09.118 --> 00:16:12.892
DO ALL THE FOLKS IN YOUR WORLD
HAVE A SEAL LIKE WE DO?

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:15.865
Asuna: NO. THAT’S SOMETHING
WE’VE NEVER HAD TO SUFFER.

00:16:15.932 --> 00:16:18.838
IN FACT, I BELIEVE
THE ONLY POINT OF DIFFERENCE

00:16:18.904 --> 00:16:21.243
BETWEEN THE UNDERWORLDERS
AND THE REAL-WORLDERS

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.816
IS HOW YOU’RE BEING FORCED
TO OBEY YOUR LAWS AND ORDERS.

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.756
WHOEVER’S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE SEAL IN YOUR EYE

00:16:27.823 --> 00:16:29.960
DOESN’T WANT YOU
HAVING FREE WILL.

00:16:30.027 --> 00:16:32.499
THEY’RE AFRAID
OF THIS PRIESTESS OF LIGHT,

00:16:32.566 --> 00:16:34.636
AS YOU CALL HER,
BECAUSE SOMEONE LIKE THAT

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.741
COULD RUIN
WHATEVER THEY HAD PLANNED.

00:16:36.807 --> 00:16:39.011
AND IF SHE APPEARED IN MY WORLD,

00:16:39.078 --> 00:16:42.919
YOUR PRIESTESS OF LIGHT WOULD BE
CONSIDERED EXTREMELY VALUABLE.

00:16:42.986 --> 00:16:45.658
Bercouli: I STILL DON’T GET
WHAT THE FUSS IS ABOUT.

00:16:45.725 --> 00:16:47.228
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF JUST NOW.

00:16:47.295 --> 00:16:49.900
THERE AIN’T A WHOLE LOT
OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR KINDS.

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:52.573
THE ONLY THING
IS THE SEAL OF THE RIGHT EYE.

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:55.244
EXCEPT FOR ALICE HERE.
SHE BROKE HER SEAL,

00:16:55.311 --> 00:16:56.280
AND ACCORDING TO YOU,

00:16:56.347 --> 00:16:58.518
SHE’S NO DIFFERENT
THAN A REAL-WORLDER NOW.

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:01.324
YOU GOT A WORLD
FULL OF YOUR KIND ALREADY,

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.926
SO WHY ARE YOU
AND YOUR ENEMIES

00:17:02.993 --> 00:17:05.799
SO OBSESSED
WITH SNATCHIN’ UP LITTLE ALICE?

00:17:05.866 --> 00:17:08.102
AND ONCE YOU DO
GET HER IN YOUR WORLD,

00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:11.042
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNIN’
ON DOIN’ WITH HER?

00:17:11.108 --> 00:17:12.512
Asuna: SORRY.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:15.484
I CAN’T SAY, NOT RIGHT NOW.

00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:17.889
SHE SHOULD SEE
THE REAL WORLD FIRST.

00:17:17.956 --> 00:17:21.263
THEN SHE CAN DECIDE WHAT SHE
WANTS TO DO FOR HERSELF.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.933
IT’S NOT HEAVEN.

00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:26.006
IT’S NO PARADISE, EITHER,
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

00:17:26.072 --> 00:17:28.944
COMPARED TO HERE,
IT’S NOT AS TRANQUIL.

00:17:29.011 --> 00:17:31.317
IT’S NOT AS PRETTY OR AS CLEAN.

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:34.289

BY HIS SIDE FOR ONE NIGHT,

SWORD SKILLS FROM HIM.

IS SORTILIENA SERLUT.

AFTER THE BATTLE TO SEE HIM,

BUT SINCE KIRITO AND I
SHARE A BIT OF HISTORY,

TO SEE HOW HE WAS FARING.
