Asuna: THIS WORLD’LL BE...

00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:17.304
- DESTROYED.
- ( Iskahn gasps )

00:13:17.371 --> 00:13:20.142
Asuna: THAT’S VECTA’S PLAN,
TO TAKE ALICE,

00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:23.717
THE PRIESTESS OF LIGHT
DOWN TO THE WORLD’S END ALTAR.

00:13:23.784 --> 00:13:26.523
AND ONCE THERE,
THIS WORLD AND EVERYTHING IN IT

00:13:26.589 --> 00:13:28.459
IS GOING TO BE WIPED OUT.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.841
Sheyta: A DRAGON
CANNOT FLY FOREVER.

00:13:35.908 --> 00:13:38.980
AND WITH PASSENGERS,
THEY ONLY LAST HALF A DAY.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.586
- ( gloves clank )
- Iskahn: RIGHT.

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:42.922
THEN I GUESS
YOU SHOULD GET GOIN’

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:43.924
WHILE THE GETTIN’S GOOD!

00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.493
Asuna: YOU’D LET US GO,

00:13:45.561 --> 00:13:47.631
JUST LIKE THAT?

00:13:47.698 --> 00:13:49.401
BUT YOU’RE
FROM THE DARK TERRITORY,

00:13:49.468 --> 00:13:50.637
AND HE’S YOUR EMPEROR.

00:13:50.704 --> 00:13:51.706
YOU’RE TALKING TREASON.

00:13:51.773 --> 00:13:53.677
Iskahn: I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:13:53.744 --> 00:13:55.046
AT THE START OF THIS,

00:13:55.113 --> 00:13:57.785
VECTA GAVE
HIS COUNCIL OF TEN AN ORDER

00:13:57.852 --> 00:14:00.423
THAT ALL HE WANTED
WAS THIS PRIESTESS OF LIGHT.

00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:03.396
AND NOW THAT HE’S
GOT WHAT HE WANTED,

00:14:03.463 --> 00:14:06.970
I’D SAY HIS ORDER TO US HAS
BEEN FULFILLED. WOULDN’T YOU?

00:14:07.036 --> 00:14:10.176
ME AND MY PEOPLE
ARE FREE TO DO WHATEVER NOW,

00:14:10.243 --> 00:14:13.115
SO IF WE WANTED TO HELP YOU
AND THE HUMAN ARMY

00:14:13.182 --> 00:14:15.453
STEAL THE PRIESTESS BACK
FROM THE EMPEROR, WE COULD.

00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:18.325
THE CHOICE IS UP TO US.

00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:19.327
( chuckles )

00:14:19.394 --> 00:14:20.329
RIGHT?

00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:21.332
( Asuna gasps )

00:14:21.398 --> 00:14:22.568
( glove creaks )

00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:24.171
Iskahn: I--

00:14:24.237 --> 00:14:27.076
WE CAN’T DISOBEY THE EMPEROR.

00:14:27.143 --> 00:14:30.083
IF HE TELLS US
WE HAVE TO FIGHT YOU,

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.555
THEN MY PEOPLE HAVE TO OBEY,

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.324
OR HE’LL KILL US.

00:14:34.391 --> 00:14:36.596
BUT HERE’S
WHAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU.

00:14:36.663 --> 00:14:38.232
WE’LL KEEP
THE RED GUYS BUSY HERE

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:41.773
WHILE YOU AND THE HUMAN ARMY
CATCH UP TO THE EMPEROR.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:47.952
WHEN YOU DO YOU,
YOU TELL HIM, THAT BASTARD,

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:50.991
WE’RE THROUGH DYIN’ FOR NOTHIN’!

00:14:51.058 --> 00:14:54.030
YOU TELL HIM
WE AIN’T HIS PUPPETS NO MORE!

00:14:54.097 --> 00:14:55.534
( Pugilists yelling )

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.573
Iskahn: NOW WE’RE TALKIN’.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.011
THAT’S IT, PEOPLE!

00:15:01.078 --> 00:15:03.049
KEEP THAT LINE OPEN, YOU HEAR?!

00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:06.421
( sighs ) THERE’S YOUR EXIT,

00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:07.658
BUT YOU BETTER HURRY UP.

00:15:07.725 --> 00:15:09.227
WE CAN’T HOLD IT FOREVER.

00:15:09.294 --> 00:15:10.898
Asuna: THANK YOU.

00:15:10.964 --> 00:15:13.837
Sheyta: I THINK
I WILL STAY HERE WITH HIM.

00:15:13.904 --> 00:15:16.274
Asuna: ALL RIGHT, THEN.
GOOD LUCK, AND STAY SAFE.

00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:19.548
( armies yelling )

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:25.761
Iskahn: YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS, WOMAN?

00:15:25.828 --> 00:15:28.666
Sheyta: STOP IT.
YOU KNOW MY NAME.

00:15:28.733 --> 00:15:30.236
Iskahn: YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS, SHEYTA?

00:15:30.303 --> 00:15:32.741
’CAUSE THERE’S NO GUARANTEE
YOU’LL SURVIVE THIS.

00:15:32.808 --> 00:15:35.146
Sheyta: I CANNOT
LET ANYONE ELSE SLASH YOU.

00:15:35.213 --> 00:15:37.417
ONLY I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO.

00:15:37.484 --> 00:15:39.087
Iskahn: HAH! SAYS YOU!

00:15:39.154 --> 00:15:40.456
( Sheyta chuckles )

00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:41.626
( Iskahn chuckles )

00:15:41.693 --> 00:15:45.399
COME ON!
SHOW ME SOME FIRE, PUGILISTS!

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:47.036
( Pugilists yelling )

00:15:47.103 --> 00:15:48.573
Iskahn: GET IN A CIRCLE!

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.043
DEFENSE POSITION!

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.246
IF ANY OF ’EM TRIES TO ATTACK,

00:15:52.313 --> 00:15:55.319
- WIND UP, AND GIVE ’EM HELL!
- ( Pugilists cheering )

00:15:55.386 --> 00:15:57.457
Dampa: READY TO KICK
SOME ASS, CHAMPION?

00:15:57.524 --> 00:15:59.194
( joints crack )

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.465
- ( gloves clank )
- Iskahn: YEAH.

00:16:05.545 --> 00:16:07.481
( Vassago moaning )

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.191
Critter: MORNING, SUNSHINE.

00:16:12.258 --> 00:16:14.194
YOU WERE OUT FOR A WHILE THERE.

00:16:14.261 --> 00:16:16.967
SAY SOMETHING SO I KNOW
YOUR BRAIN DIDN’T GET FRIED.

00:16:17.034 --> 00:16:18.036
Vassago: ASSHOLE.

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:20.307
( groans ) DAMN IT.

00:16:20.374 --> 00:16:24.182
I DIED. I FELL DOWN
SOME BOTTOMLESS PIT.

00:16:24.248 --> 00:16:27.021
Critter: OOH, THAT SOUNDS
BOTH HORRIBLE AND PATHETIC.

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:30.026
YOU KNOW, YOU BEEN OUT
FOR EIGHT HOURS NOW.

00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:32.164
Vassago: WAIT. EIGHT HOURS?

00:16:33.433 --> 00:16:35.671
Critter: WHY DO YOU LOOK
SO PANICKED, MAN?

00:16:35.738 --> 00:16:37.441
EVERYTHING’S COOL.

00:16:37.508 --> 00:16:39.880
RIGHT BEFORE
YOU GOT YOUR ASS OWNED IN THERE,

00:16:39.947 --> 00:16:42.250
I DIALED THE TIME
BACK DOWN TO ONE-TO-ONE.

00:16:42.317 --> 00:16:44.255
Vassago: WHAT? SON OF A BITCH!

00:16:44.321 --> 00:16:47.228
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU MESSIN’
AROUND WITH THE TIME FOR?!

00:16:47.294 --> 00:16:49.566
- ( Critter gags )
- Vassago: IN 12 HOURS,

00:16:49.632 --> 00:16:52.873
THE JSDF IS GONNA BUST IN HERE,
AND THEY’LL BE GUNNIN’ FOR US!

00:16:52.939 --> 00:16:54.643
Critter: I KNOW.
I’VE BEEN KEEPING UP.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.851
I CRANKED THE TIME DOWN ’CAUSE
CAPTAIN MILLER ORDERED ME TO.

00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:00.555
USING OUR SATELLITE CONNECTION,

00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:02.725
I JUST LOGGED A BUNCH
OF PLAYERS FROM THE U.S.

00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:04.562
INTO THE DARK TERRITORY.

00:17:04.629 --> 00:17:05.999
Vassago: THE HELL FOR?

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:08.236
( Critter chuckles )

00:17:09.706 --> 00:17:11.141
THAT’S A LOG OF YOU

00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:13.112
AND THE CAP’S MOVEMENTS
IN THERE.

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:16.119
A FEW MINUTES AGO,
HE PASSED THE PLACE YOU CROAKED

00:17:16.186 --> 00:17:18.724
AND IS HEADING DUE SOUTH.
AND GET THIS.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.663
HE’S NOT TRAVELING
WITH THE DARK TERRITORY’S ARMY.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.669
HE’S ON HIS OWN,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:27.942
Vassago: HE COULD BE CHASING
AFTER ALICE, OR HE’S GOT HER.

00:17:28.009 --> 00:17:30.014
EITHER WAY,
YOU SHOULD CRANK UP THE TIME.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.051
Critter: NOPE. NOT YET.

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:34.187
WE HAVE A PROBLEM. CHECK IT OUT.

00:17:35.624 --> 00:17:36.527
THAT PART IN RED

00:17:36.594 --> 00:17:38.430
IS WHAT’S LEFT
OF THE U.S. PLAYERS,

00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:40.534
AND THAT BLACK CIRCLE
HALF-SURROUNDED BY ’EM

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.672
IS A CHUNK
OF THE DARK TERRITORY’S ARMY.

00:17:42.739 --> 00:17:45.377
OUR PROBLEM IS THAT WHITE DOT.

00:17:45.444 --> 00:17:48.282
THAT’S THE HUMAN ARMY,
OR WHAT’S LEFT OF ’EM.

00:17:48.349 --> 00:17:51.322
ACCORDING TO THE LOG,
THERE’S ABOUT 700, GIVE OR TAKE.

00:17:51.389 --> 00:17:54.762
IF THEY CATCH UP TO THE CAPTAIN,
THAT WOULD BE NO BUENO.

00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:57.133
THEY GOTTA BE STOPPED ASAP.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.937
Vassago: THEN YOU
BETTER GET TO IT.

00:17:59.004 --> 00:18:00.006
WHAT YOU GOT IN MIND?

00:18:00.073 --> 00:18:02.244
( Critter laughs )

00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:06.219
I GOT US A SECOND BATCH
OF U.S. PLAYERS ON STANDBY.

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:08.056
WHEN THERE’S 20 THOU,

00:18:08.123 --> 00:18:10.227
I’LL DROP ’EM
ON TOP OF THE HUMAN ARMY.

00:18:10.294 --> 00:18:12.497
THAT’S 28 TIMES THEIR NUMBERS.

00:18:12.565 --> 00:18:14.502
IT’S GONNA BE
A FRIGGIN’ MASSACRE!

00:18:14.569 --> 00:18:17.474
THEN I’LL CRANK TIME UP
TO 1,000-TO-ONE.

00:18:17.541 --> 00:18:20.681
WE’LL SIT BACK AND
LET THE CAPTAIN DO HIS THING.

00:18:20.748 --> 00:18:23.352
HE’LL HAVE ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD AND THEN SOME

00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:25.424
TO GET ALICE
TO THE SOUTHERN TERMINAL.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.196
Vassago: I HOPE IT GOES
AS SMOOTH AS YOU SAY.

00:18:28.262 --> 00:18:29.633
THE HUMAN SIDE’S ARMY

00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:32.170
IS A HELL OF A LOT TOUGHER
THAN YOU THINK.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.545
HELL, THOSE INTEGRITY KNIGHTS
ARE STRAIGHT-UP BAD-ASSES.

00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:37.213
I SAT THERE AND WATCHED

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.653
AS THEY MOWED DOWN
THE DARK TERRITORY’S FRONT LINE.

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:43.093
WE LOST THOUSANDS
IN ONE GIGANTIC FLASH OF--

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.997
FLASH OF--( gasps )

00:18:45.063 --> 00:18:47.334

00:18:49.138 --> 00:18:50.407
IT TOTALLY WAS!

00:18:50.474 --> 00:18:52.579
I’LL NEVER FORGET THAT BITCH.

00:18:52.645 --> 00:18:54.516
Critter: WHAT? WHO ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT? ( groans )

00:18:54.582 --> 00:18:57.689
Vassago: GUESS WHAT,
YOU LITTLE FOUR-EYED FREAK.

00:18:57.755 --> 00:19:00.026
I JUST FIGURED OUT
THE RATH GUYS IN SUBCON

00:19:00.093 --> 00:19:02.197
ARE DOIN’ THE SAME THING WE ARE.

00:19:02.263 --> 00:19:06.139
YEAH, BUT THEY GOT
JAPANESE VRMMO PLAYERS LOGGED IN

00:19:06.205 --> 00:19:07.542
AND WORKING WITH THE HUMAN ARMY.

00:19:07.609 --> 00:19:09.311
- Critter: NO WAY!
- Vassago: AND I’LL BET,

00:19:09.378 --> 00:19:11.784

IN THERE,

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.088

IS, TOO.
