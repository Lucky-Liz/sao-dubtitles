WEBVTT

00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:16.612
Asuna: I GOT THIS!

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.622
( Kirito yells )

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:27.634
Player: WELL,
THAT’S THE END OF THAT.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.139
ALL TEAMS, RETREAT.

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:32.711
GRID ONE-NINE’S TOO HOT.

00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:36.184
Player #2: AW, WE COULD
HAVE KILLED ’EM ALL
IF WE STUCK WITH IT.

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:39.457
YOU SURE YOU WANNA
END THE DAY LIKE THIS, BOSS?

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.330
Player #1: THAT TEAM’S
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:44.434
FIGHTING THEM
WON’T HELP WITH OUR TRAINING.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:48.576
WE HAVE A BIG MISSION COMING UP,
AND WE NEED TO STAY SHARP.

00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:49.711
LET’S GO.

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:04.708
( man sighs ) HMM?

00:01:08.348 --> 00:01:11.655
Woman: MR. MILLER, THE PEOPLE
FROM THE N.S.A. ARE HERE.

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:13.491
Miller: SEND THEM IN, PLEASE.

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:17.667
Agent: MR. MILLER,
WE’D LIKE TO RETAIN THE SERVICES

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:21.475
OF GLOWGEN DEFENSE SYSTEMS
FOR A TOP-SECRET MISSION.

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:23.278
Miller: WHAT IS THE NATURE
OF THE MISSION?

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:26.552
Agent: TO ACQUIRE A PIECE
OF TECH CALLED SOUL TRANSLATION.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.455
Miller: I’M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH WHAT THAT IS.

00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:31.394
Agent: A JAPANESE COMPANY
CALLED RATH DEVELOPED IT.

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:34.234
IT’S A MACHINE
CAPABLE OF ANALYZING A SOUL.

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:37.473
Miller: A HUMAN SOUL?
THAT’S HARD TO BELIEVE.

00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:40.313
Agent: YES, WELL,
IT’S BEEN VERIFIED.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:42.383
WITH THIS SOUL TRANSLATION TECH,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.255
NOT ONLY CAN RATH
SCAN AND READ A SOUL,

00:01:45.322 --> 00:01:47.026
THEY CAN CLONE IT.

00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:49.732
THE PROJECT IS CODE-NAMED ALICE,

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.303
AND ITS GOAL IS TO DEVELOP
AN ARTIFICIAL SOUL

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.376
TO PILOT MILITARY DRONES.
THAT KIND OF TECH

00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:58.415
WOULD DISRUPT THE BALANCE
OF POWER IN EAST ASIA.

00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:01.288
Agent 2: NEEDLESS TO SAY,
THE U.S. IS CONCERNED

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.158
AND WANTS TO KEEP THAT
FROM HAPPENING.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.496
Miller: UNDERSTANDABLE.

00:02:05.563 --> 00:02:07.066
PLEASE GO ON.

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.237
WHAT ARE THE SPECIFICS
OF THE MISSION?

00:02:09.304 --> 00:02:12.210
Agent 2: THERE’S A MEGA-FLOAT
MOORED NEAR THE IZU ISLANDS.

00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:14.213
IT’S CALLED THE OCEAN TURTLE.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.451
WE NEED YOU
TO INFILTRATE THE FACILITY,

00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:18.756
SECURE
THE SOUL TRANSLATION TECH,

00:02:18.823 --> 00:02:20.492
AND BRING IT BACK.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.264
Miller: SO YOU WANT TO RAID
A JAPANESE VESSEL,

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:25.069
ONE OF OUR ALLIES.

00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:28.175
Agent 2: WE HAVE
A CONTACT INSIDE THE J.S.D.F.

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:29.678
THEY’LL BE SURE
TO LEAVE THE WINDOW

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:31.214
OPEN FOR YOU ON THE DAY.

00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:33.653
USE WHATEVER METHODS YOU WANT.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.491
JUST KEEP IN MIND
THIS IS OFF THE BOOKS.

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.631
YOU WON’T GET ANY SUPPORT
FROM THE U.S. IF YOU GET CAUGHT.

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:43.371
Miller: ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.144
I’LL ASSEMBLE A TEAM

00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:48.314
AND LEAD THIS MISSION MYSELF.

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:52.691
( chuckles ) ALICE.

00:02:52.758 --> 00:02:54.695
YOUR SOUL WILL BE SWEET,

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:56.698
MAYBE THE SWEETEST YET.

00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:37.195
- ( thump )
- Miller: HMM?

00:04:37.262 --> 00:04:39.734
Merc: SAY THAT AGAIN, CRITTER.
I DARE YOU.

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:43.041
Critter: SURE, VASSAGO,
BUT IT WON’T CHANGE A THING.

00:04:43.107 --> 00:04:46.380
THE LOCK ON THIS SYSTEM’S
TOUGHER THAN DRIED SHIT.

00:04:46.447 --> 00:04:49.286
I COULD TRY AND CRACK IT
WITH THE LAPTOP WE BROUGHT,

00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:51.992
BUT YOU’D DIE OF OLD AGE
BEFORE I GOT IN.

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.198
THEY BONED US, AND THERE’S
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:56.433
Vassago: THAT AIN’T
ALL YOU SAID,

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:58.404
YOU FOUR-EYED SCUMBAG.

00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.543
YOU SAID, "WE WOULDN’T
BE STUCK LIKE THIS

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.446
IF WE WEREN’T SO SLOW
GETTING IN HERE."

00:05:02.514 --> 00:05:04.450
Critter: SO WHAT IF I DID?

00:05:04.518 --> 00:05:06.788
I WAS JUST POINTING OUT
THE FACTS, IS AL--

00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:09.594
Vassago: NEXT TIME, INSTEAD OF
WAITING FOR THE ALL-CLEAR,

00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:12.065
YOU’RE COMING UP FRONT
WITH US, YOU PUSSY.

00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:13.100
( fingers snap )

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:14.203
Miller: ENOUGH.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.508
YOU BOYS BETTER COOL DOWN.

00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:19.279
THIS ISN’T THE TIME TO START
POINTING FINGERS AT EACH OTHER.

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:21.785
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.

00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:23.187
Vassago: AW, COME ON, BRO!

00:05:23.254 --> 00:05:26.293
LET ME PUT THIS WORM
IN HIS PLACE.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.730
Miller: I SAID STAND DOWN.

00:05:27.797 --> 00:05:30.201
EVERYONE DID
WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO.

00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:33.843
ASIDE FROM GARY GETTING WINGED
BY A ROUND, THE TEAM’S INTACT.

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.613
AND NOW THAT WE’RE
IN THE CONTROL ROOM,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.118
WE’RE EXACTLY WHERE
WE NEED TO BE TO GET THIS DONE.

00:05:38.184 --> 00:05:39.755
Vassago: GET WHAT DONE?

00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:41.758
IF WE CAN’T GET
ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM,

00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:44.296
THEN WE CAN’T GET
WHAT WE CAME HERE TO GET.

00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:46.466
THE SCHEMATICS SAID
EVERYTHING’S AUTOMATED,

00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:49.106
AND THE LIGHTCUBE CLUSTER
THING’S BEHIND A WALL OF STEEL.

00:05:49.173 --> 00:05:52.112
Miller: RIGHT.
SO, ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:54.584
IS FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO BREACH THAT WALL.

00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:57.256
Vassago: YEAH, WELL,
THE S.D.F. AGENTS ONBOARD

00:05:57.322 --> 00:05:59.126
AIN’T GONNA HIDE
IN THEIR HOLES FOREVER.

00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:01.832
AND, WHEN THAT SHIP OUTSIDE
FIGURES OUT WHAT’S WHAT,

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:03.602
WE’LL BE UP TO OUR ASS
IN SOLDIERS.

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.371
Miller: THE CLIENT TOLD ME

00:06:05.438 --> 00:06:08.545
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE J.S.D.F.

00:06:08.612 --> 00:06:11.283
THEY ASSURED ME
WE’D HAVE A 24-HOUR WINDOW

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.452
BEFORE THE SHIP ROLLED IN.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.057
Critter: OOH! ESPIONAGE!

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:18.097
THAT’S WAY BETTER THAN
A BORING OLD SMASH-AND-GRAB.

00:06:18.164 --> 00:06:20.302
( Miller chuckles ) ALL RIGHT.

00:06:20.368 --> 00:06:21.838
LET’S GO OVER THE SITUATION.

00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:25.278
WE STORMED THE FACILITY
40 MINUTES AGO.

00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:28.819
RIGHT NOW,
IT’S 14:47, LOCAL TIME.

00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:31.157
WE’RE STANDING
IN THE MAIN CONTROL ROOM

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.359
OF THE OCEAN TURTLE.

00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:34.129
WE’VE BEEN LOCKED
OUT OF THE SYSTEM,

00:06:34.196 --> 00:06:35.632
AND WE WERE UNABLE TO CAPTURE

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.904
ANY RATH STAFF
TO HELP US UNLOCK IT--

00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.742
A MINOR SETBACK,
NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:43.782
OUR NEW OBJECTIVE IS TO
INFILTRATE THE SUB CONTROL ROOM

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.352
AND TRY FROM THERE.

00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:47.389
WELL, BRIGG?
DO YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLE

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:48.993
TO CUT THROUGH
THE BULKHEAD DOOR?

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.097
Brigg: NOT WITH
THE KIND OF GEAR WE BROUGHT.

00:06:51.164 --> 00:06:54.303
IT’S MADE OUT OF SOME KIND
OF ROCK-HARD COMPOSITE MATERIAL.

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:56.340
IF WE GOTTA BE
OUT OF HERE IN 24,

00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:58.144
THE PORTABLE SAW AIN’T ENOUGH.

00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.550
WE NEED SOMETHING
BIGGER AND SHARPER.

00:07:00.616 --> 00:07:04.222
Miller: ALL RIGHT.
HANS, CAN WE USE C-4 TO BLOW IT?

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:05.793
Hans: SURE,
BUT I WOULDN’T RECOMMEND IT.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.063
THE CHAMBER
WITH THE LIGHTCUBE CLUSTER

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.403
IS SUPPOSED TO BE
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE WALL THERE.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.474
IF WE BLOW THE DOOR,
WE’D RISK DAMAGING THE CHAMBER

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:15.144
AND EVERYTHING IN IT.

00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:16.548
Miller: HMM.

00:07:16.614 --> 00:07:19.687
ALL RIGHT, SOMEHOW WE
HAVE TO FIND ONE LIGHTCUBE

00:07:19.754 --> 00:07:22.359
IN A VAULT OF THOUSANDS
AND RETRIEVE IT.

00:07:22.426 --> 00:07:23.628
WE HAVE THE CUBE’S I.D.

00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:25.933
AS LONG AS WE HAVE
A WORKING CONSOLE,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.506
WE CAN EJECT IT
ALONG WITH ITS INTERFACE.

00:07:28.572 --> 00:07:30.041
Vassago: PIECE OF CAKE.

00:07:30.107 --> 00:07:33.516
THANK GOD WE BROUGHT SEÑOR DORK
ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

00:07:33.582 --> 00:07:35.552
ALL THAT B.S.
ABOUT HACKING THE PENTAGON.

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:37.322
IF YOU WERE REALLY THAT GOOD,

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:39.326
YOU WOULD HAVE
HAD THIS SYSTEM OPEN BY NOW.

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:41.598
Critter: LISTEN
TO THE SUPER SOLDIER.

00:07:41.665 --> 00:07:43.569
UP TO NOW,
THE ONLY COMBAT YOU’VE SEEN’S

00:07:43.636 --> 00:07:45.706
BEEN THE VIRTUAL KIND, HOSS.

00:07:45.772 --> 00:07:47.910
( Vassago growls ) GODDAMN NERD!

00:07:50.314 --> 00:07:51.618
( both gasp )

00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:54.624
Miller: DO YOU WANT
TO GO BACK EMPTY-HANDED

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.961
AND, INSTEAD OF A BIG,
FAT BONUS, GET LAUGHED AT?

00:07:58.464 --> 00:07:59.968
Vassago: HELL, NO.

00:08:00.034 --> 00:08:02.372
Miller: AND HOW ABOUT YOU?
ARE YOU GONNA LET

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:04.710
SOME AMATEUR PROGRAMMERS
LOCK YOU OUT?

00:08:04.777 --> 00:08:06.280
Critter: NO.

00:08:06.347 --> 00:08:08.384
Miller: THEN, THINK, DAMN IT!

00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:11.056
COME UP WITH A WAY TO GET IN
AND PROVE YOU GOT

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:14.363
MORE THAN OATMEAL
IN YOUR SKULLS. UNDERSTOOD?!

00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:16.099
Mercs: YES, SIR!

00:08:18.237 --> 00:08:19.974
♪♪

00:08:22.246 --> 00:08:25.418
Miller: THE PRESSURIZED BULKHEAD
LEADING TO THE LIGHTCUBE CLUSTER

00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:27.556
CAN’T BE BREACHED.

00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:31.163
WE HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY
TO ACCESS IT FROM HERE.

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:32.600
WHAT YOU GOT?

00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:34.905
Critter: ADMIN PRIVILEGES
CAN’T UNLOCK THE SYSTEM.

00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:37.910
ALL I CAN DO IS BRING UP
A VISUAL OF THE WORLD

00:08:37.977 --> 00:08:40.448
SO WE CAN SEE WHAT
ALL THE FLUCTLIGHTS ARE DOING,

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:42.686
BASICALLY, WATCH ’EM
LIVING THEIR LIVES

00:08:42.753 --> 00:08:44.690
IN THEIR LITTLE
FAIRY-TALE KINGDOM.

00:08:48.163 --> 00:08:49.433
Miller: GOBLINS?

00:08:49.501 --> 00:08:51.771
Critter: YOU KNOW
YOUR FANTASY TROPES, CAPTAIN.

00:08:51.838 --> 00:08:54.744
Vassago: THEY SEEM KINDA BIG
FOR REGULAR GOBLINS.

00:08:54.811 --> 00:08:57.248
YEAH. THOSE THINGS
ARE HOBGOBLINS.

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:00.054
Miller: CRITTER.

00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:01.525
Critter: HMM. YEAH?

00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:03.294
Miller: ARE THOSE CREATURES
PART OF THE SYSTEM,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.496
LIKE N.P.C.s?

00:09:04.563 --> 00:09:05.666
Critter: MM-MMM.

00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:07.670
NOT ACCORDING
TO WHAT I’M SEEING.

00:09:07.737 --> 00:09:11.410
CHECK IT OUT. THEY ALL GOT
THEIR OWN LIGHTCUBE DESIGNATION,

00:09:11.477 --> 00:09:13.649
WHICH MEANS
THEY’RE IN THE CLUSTER.

00:09:13.716 --> 00:09:15.351
THOSE THINGS ALL HAVE SOULS.

00:09:15.418 --> 00:09:17.456
Vassago: YOU’RE KIDDING!

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:20.963
THOSE HOBGOBLINS
HAVE HUMAN SOULS, SAME AS US?

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.267
YO, CHECK OUT
WHAT THE OTHER LIGHTCUBES GOT!

00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:26.140
LIKE, MAYBE THEY’RE ALL FILLED
WITH GOBLIN AND ORC SOULS, TOO!

00:09:26.207 --> 00:09:27.142
MAYBE ALICE IS ONE!

00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:28.512
Critter: WOULD YOU CHILL?

00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:29.814
LOOK AT THE SCREEN.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.118
THE UNDERWORLD IS SPLIT
INTO THE HUMAN EMPIRE,

00:09:32.185 --> 00:09:34.089
WHERE, YOU KNOW, HUMANS LIVE.

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.024
AND, SURROUNDING THAT,

00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:36.628
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAINS,

00:09:36.694 --> 00:09:39.500
IS THE DARK TERRITORY,
WHERE THE MONSTERS ARE.

00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:41.103
WITH A NAME LIKE ALICE,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.909
I’M PRETTY SURE
SHE’S BOTH A SHE AND HUMAN.

00:09:43.976 --> 00:09:46.213
THE PROBLEM IS,
THE HUMAN PART IS SO BIG

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:50.087
AND FILLED WITH PEOPLE,
WE’LL NEVER FIND HER LIKE THIS.

00:09:50.154 --> 00:09:52.458
Vassago: NOT SITTING OUT HERE,
THAT’S FOR SURE.

00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:53.896
BUT, IN THERE, WE COULD.

00:09:53.962 --> 00:09:56.267
IF THEY GOT A CIVILIZATION,
THEY CAN TALK,

00:09:56.334 --> 00:09:57.503
SO JUST DROP ME IN,

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.439
AND I CAN ASK AROUND
’TIL I FIND HER.

00:09:59.507 --> 00:10:00.341
Critter: GOOD IDEA!

00:10:00.408 --> 00:10:01.544
FOR A DUMB-ASS.

00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:02.580
Vassago: YOU LITTLE BASTARD!

00:10:02.647 --> 00:10:04.483
Critter: STOP AND THINK.

00:10:04.551 --> 00:10:05.619
THERE’S TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

00:10:05.686 --> 00:10:07.155
LIVING IN THE HUMAN EMPIRE.

00:10:07.222 --> 00:10:09.827
IT’S HUGE,
AND YOU’RE JUST ONE PERSON.

00:10:09.894 --> 00:10:13.133
- YOU CAN’T ASK EVERY...ONE.
- Vassago: HUH?

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.637
Critter: UNLESS...

00:10:14.703 --> 00:10:16.575
YOU’RE SOMEONE WITH SOME CLOUT.

00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:17.977
Miller: GOOD POINT.

00:10:18.043 --> 00:10:20.314
THE RESEARCHERS
MUST HAVE SPECIAL ACCOUNTS

00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:21.885
THEY COULD USE TO LOG IN THERE.

00:10:21.952 --> 00:10:23.287
IT’S A SAFE BET THOSE ACCOUNTS

00:10:23.354 --> 00:10:25.559
WOULD BE A HIGHER LEVEL
THAN THE AVERAGE CITIZEN.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.594
ISN’T THAT RIGHT, CRITTER?

00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:29.968
Critter: YEAH, BOSS. EXACTLY!

00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:31.771
OUT OF ALL THE RANKS
AND CLASSES,

00:10:31.838 --> 00:10:34.711
THE RATH PEEPS
HAD TO SET ASIDE A FEW TO USE.

00:10:34.778 --> 00:10:36.380
THAT WAY, THEY COULD MONITOR

00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:38.685
AND TWEAK THE WORLD
FROM INSIDE.

00:10:38.752 --> 00:10:41.456
Vassago: UH-HUH.
NOW WE’RE TALKING.

00:10:41.524 --> 00:10:44.395
HEY, HOW ’BOUT
IF I LOG IN AS A GENERAL

00:10:44.462 --> 00:10:46.267
OR PRESIDENT
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:49.206
I’D GIVE THE ORDER TO FIND ALICE
AND LET THE GRUNTS DO THE WORK.

00:10:49.272 --> 00:10:52.212
Critter: OH, MY GOD.
NOW THAT I HEAR YOU SAY IT,

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:55.385
I’M NOT SO SURE
I’M A FAN OF THE IDEA ANYMORE.

00:10:55.452 --> 00:10:57.756
EH, BALLS.

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:00.394
THEY GOT
ALL THESE HIGH-LEVEL ACCOUNTS

00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:02.498
LOCKED DOWN
AS TIGHT AS THE SYSTEM.

00:11:02.566 --> 00:11:04.603
IF WE DIVE IN
TO THE HUMAN EMPIRE,

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.776
IT’S GONNA BE AS
A PLAIN OLD, LOW-LEVEL PERSON.

00:11:07.843 --> 00:11:10.181
Vassago: DAMN IT.
SO MUCH FOR THAT IDEA.

00:11:10.248 --> 00:11:12.620
Miller: NO. TRY AGAIN,

00:11:12.687 --> 00:11:15.358
BUT, THIS TIME, SEARCH
FOR ANY HIGH-LEVEL ACCOUNTS

00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.095
OUTSIDE THE HUMAN EMPIRE.

00:11:17.162 --> 00:11:18.297
Critter: OUTSIDE IT?

00:11:18.363 --> 00:11:21.437
OKAY, BUT THE CHANCES
OF ALICE BEING IN MONSTER LAND

00:11:21.504 --> 00:11:22.506
IS CLOSE TO NIL.

00:11:22.573 --> 00:11:24.844
Miller: YES, I’M AWARE OF THAT.

00:11:24.911 --> 00:11:27.583
BUT, IF ALL THAT SEPARATES
THE TWO REGIONS ARE MOUNTAINS,

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:28.619
THEY CAN BE CROSSED.

00:11:28.685 --> 00:11:29.920
Vassago: YEAH!

00:11:29.987 --> 00:11:31.558
THAT’S WHY YOU’RE IN CHARGE!

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.427
ALWAYS THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX.

00:11:33.494 --> 00:11:34.530
I CAN SEE IT NOW.

00:11:34.597 --> 00:11:36.534
I’LL DIVE IN AS A BOSS MONSTER

00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:37.937
AND LEAD A RAID ON THE HUMANS.

00:11:38.004 --> 00:11:39.674
( chuckles )
I’D BE DOWN WITH THAT.

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:42.713
( Critter whistles ) LOOK!

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.382
I THINK I FOUND
A COUPLE CONTENDERS.

00:11:46.655 --> 00:11:49.092
NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, GENTS.

00:11:49.158 --> 00:11:50.629
SPECS LOOK GOOD.

00:11:50.695 --> 00:11:52.398
THIS ONE’S CLASSIFIED
AS A DARK KNIGHT.

00:11:52.465 --> 00:11:54.435
SO EDGY.

00:11:54.503 --> 00:11:57.342
AND HIS
OBJECT CONTROL LEVEL’S AT 70.

00:11:57.408 --> 00:11:58.878
HE’S A BAD-ASS TO THE BONE!

00:11:58.945 --> 00:12:01.116
Vassago: SWEET.
RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.

00:12:01.183 --> 00:12:03.153
YO, I GOT DIBS
ON THE DARK KNIGHT.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.626
I FOUND ANOTHER ACCOUNT
THAT WE CAN ACCESS.

00:12:05.693 --> 00:12:07.428
EH? WELL, THAT’S WEIRD.

00:12:07.495 --> 00:12:10.703
THERE’S NO RANK, AND IT
DOESN’T HAVE A LEVEL, EITHER,

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.608
NO DURABILITY,
SYSTEM CONTROL AUTHORITY.

00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:15.378
THE ONLY SETTING IS ITS NAME,

00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:18.551
EMPEROR VECTA.

00:12:18.618 --> 00:12:22.325
Vassago: HELL, YEAH. THAT GUY’S
THE KING OF THE MONSTER WORLD.

00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:23.695
CHANGED MY MIND. I’LL BE HIM.

00:12:23.762 --> 00:12:24.664
- Miller: NO.
- Vassago: EH?

00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:26.066
Miller: I’LL USE THAT ACCOUNT.

00:12:27.937 --> 00:12:30.140
Vassago: ALL RIGHT, BRO.
YOU’RE THE EMPEROR,

00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:31.978
AND I’M COOL
BEING A DARK KNIGHT.

00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:33.749
LET’S GET THIS SHOW
ON THE ROAD.

00:12:33.816 --> 00:12:36.320
I WANNA CHOP SOME FOOLS
WITH MY SWORD!

00:12:36.387 --> 00:12:37.656
COME ON, FOUR EYES.

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:39.426
WHAT DO WE GOTTA DO TO LOG IN?

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:40.596
( Critter sighs )

00:12:40.663 --> 00:12:42.098
Miller: SPEAK UP, CRITTER.

00:12:42.165 --> 00:12:44.102
SOMETHING’S OBVIOUSLY
BOTHERING YOU.

00:12:44.169 --> 00:12:47.743
Critter: MAYBE I’M
JUST BEING OVERCAUTIOUS,

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.479
BUT I KEEP SEEING THE SAME TERM

00:12:49.547 --> 00:12:51.884
POP UP AGAIN AND AGAIN
IN THESE LOGS.

00:12:51.951 --> 00:12:54.691
IT MIGHT NOT AFFECT OUR OP,
BUT STILL...

00:12:54.757 --> 00:12:57.362
Miller: GO ON.
WHAT IS THIS TERM?

00:12:57.429 --> 00:13:00.000
Critter: "THE FINAL LOAD TEST."

00:13:03.677 --> 00:13:05.246
Higa: HOW DO I PUT THIS?

00:13:05.313 --> 00:13:08.987
AS FAR AS KIRITO’S
REAL-WORLD CONDITION,

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:10.625
IT’S LIKE I SAID BEFORE.

00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:13.029
THINGS AREN’T
LOOKING TOO GOOD FOR HIM.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.932
THE ONLY THING
THAT GIVES ME HOPE

00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:17.872
IS HE’S STILL LOGGED IN
TO THE UNDERWORLD.

00:13:17.938 --> 00:13:21.445
THAT’S GOOD. SEE, EVEN THOUGH
HIS SELF-IMAGE IS DAMAGED,

00:13:21.513 --> 00:13:24.819
HIS FLUCTLIGHT’S STILL ACTIVE
AND RECEIVING STIMULI,

00:13:24.886 --> 00:13:27.424
SO THERE’S A CHANCE
HIS NEURAL NETWORK CAN HEAL.

00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:29.161
I WAS THINKING.

00:13:29.227 --> 00:13:30.731
HIS GUILT
OVER LOSING HIS FRIENDS

00:13:30.797 --> 00:13:32.601
IS WHAT DAMAGED HIS SOUL, RIGHT?

00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:35.508
WHAT IF--
AND IT’S A BIG WHAT IF.

00:13:35.575 --> 00:13:37.210
WHAT IF SOMEONE FORGAVE HIM?

00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:38.145
THAT MIGHT HELP.

00:13:39.648 --> 00:13:40.584
Kikuoka: HUH?

00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:42.555
Asuna: SEND ME. I’LL GO.

00:13:42.622 --> 00:13:44.859
Rinko: A-ASUNA.

00:13:50.136 --> 00:13:53.342
Asuna: I’LL GO.
LOG ME IN TO THE UNDERWORLD.

00:13:55.013 --> 00:13:58.118
I WANT TO TELL HIM
THAT HE DID ALL HE COULD...

00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:00.323
THAT IT’S OKAY,

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.595
THAT, AFTER ALL THE PAIN

00:14:02.662 --> 00:14:04.665
AND SADNESS I KNOW HE SUFFERED,

00:14:04.732 --> 00:14:08.473
IN THE END,
HE DID THE BEST HE COULD.

00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:09.776
Kikuoka: ALL RIGHT.

00:14:09.843 --> 00:14:12.748
WE HAVE ANOTHER S.T.L.
WE CAN USE.

00:14:12.815 --> 00:14:15.119
BUT THE UNDERWORLD’S
AT A CRITICAL STAGE.

00:14:15.186 --> 00:14:17.323
IT’S NOT EXACTLY STABLE
RIGHT NOW.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.965
IT’S SCHEDULED TO ENTER
THE FINAL LOAD TEST SOON,

00:14:21.031 --> 00:14:23.336
THE LAST PHASE
OF THE EXPERIMENT.

00:14:23.402 --> 00:14:25.540
Rinko: FINAL LOAD TEST?

00:14:25.607 --> 00:14:27.277
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

00:14:27.343 --> 00:14:29.582
Higa: THE EASTERN GATE
SEPARATES THE HUMAN EMPIRE

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:30.951
FROM THE DARK TERRITORY.

00:14:31.018 --> 00:14:32.988
ONCE ITS DURABILITY LEVEL
HITS ZERO,

00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:35.359
THE MONSTERS
WILL INVADE THE HUMAN SIDE.

00:14:35.426 --> 00:14:39.334
IF THE HUMANS WERE ABLE TO
BUILD UP THEIR DEFENSES IN TIME,

00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:42.074
THEY COULD DRIVE THE MONSTERS
BACK TO THEIR SIDE,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.211
BUT NOW IT’S UP IN THE AIR.

00:14:44.278 --> 00:14:47.685
KIRITO PRETTY MUCH DESTROYED
THE AXIOM CHURCH,

00:14:47.752 --> 00:14:49.622
THE RULING BODY THERE,

00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:51.893
SO WHO KNOWS
WHAT’LL HAPPEN NOW?

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.232
Kikuoka: AT THIS POINT,
HAVING SOMEONE DIVE IN THERE

00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:58.541
MIGHT BE THE BEST COURSE
OF ACTION FOR ALL OUR CONCERNS.

00:14:58.607 --> 00:15:01.145
ONCE THE INVASION BEGINS,

00:15:01.211 --> 00:15:04.150
THERE’S NO TELLING HOW CHAOTIC
THE UNDERWORLD WILL GET,

00:15:04.217 --> 00:15:06.355
AND THERE’S A GOOD CHANCE
ALICE COULD BE KILLED.

00:15:06.421 --> 00:15:10.363
BUT, IF WE SEND SOMEONE IN
USING A HIGH-LEVEL ACCOUNT,

00:15:10.429 --> 00:15:13.269
THEY COULD FIND ALICE AND
HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP HER SAFE

00:15:13.336 --> 00:15:15.674
LONG ENOUGH TO GET HER
TO THE WORLD END’S ALTAR.

00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:18.246
THEN, USING THE TERMINAL THERE,

00:15:18.312 --> 00:15:21.218
THEY CAN EJECT HER LIGHTCUBE
TO THIS CONTROL ROOM.

00:15:21.285 --> 00:15:23.924
Rinko: AH! SO THAT’S
WHY YOU TOLD KIRITO

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.393
TO TAKE HER THERE, TO EJECT HER.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.096
( Kikuoka sighs )

00:15:27.163 --> 00:15:31.371
HE’D HAVE GOTTEN HER THERE
BY NOW IF HE WERE ABLE TO.

00:15:31.438 --> 00:15:34.378
YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.
SHE WAS RIGHT THERE WITH HIM.

00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:37.719
Rinko: TIME THERE’S ACCELERATED,
SO, BY NOW, MONTHS HAVE PASSED.

00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:39.020
DO YOU THINK THERE’S A CHANCE

00:15:39.087 --> 00:15:41.325
THEY’RE STILL TOGETHER,
EVEN NOW?

00:15:41.392 --> 00:15:43.564
Higa: I’D SAY
IT’S A GOOD BET THEY ARE.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.003
AND PERSONALLY, I THINK,
IF ANYONE’S GONNA DIVE IN,

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.241
IT SHOULD BE ASUNA.

00:15:49.308 --> 00:15:52.013
SHE’S OUR BEST HOPE
AT BREAKING THROUGH TO KIRITO.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.184
PLUS SHE’S GOT
THE COMBAT SKILLS

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.223
TO PROTECT ALICE
AND GET HER TO THE TERMINAL.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.963
Kikuoka: YOU DON’T NEED
TO CONVINCE ME ABOUT THAT.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.097
ALL RIGHT, LET’S FIND HER

00:16:01.164 --> 00:16:02.768
A HIGH-LEVEL ACCOUNT
TO DIVE IN WITH.

00:16:02.835 --> 00:16:05.707
Higa: SURE THING.
I GOT TONS OF OPTIONS.

00:16:05.774 --> 00:16:08.580
A KNIGHT, A GENERAL, A NOBLE--

00:16:08.647 --> 00:16:11.084
WHATEVER YOU PICK’S
GONNA HAVE HIGH STATS, ASUNA.

00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:13.489
Rinko: WAIT.
I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:14.525
