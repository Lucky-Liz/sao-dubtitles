00:13:55.447 --> 00:13:56.950
Critter: Damn it!

00:13:57.016 --> 00:13:59.288
What’s that idiot
standing around for?!

00:13:59.354 --> 00:14:01.158
( gasps )

00:14:03.095 --> 00:14:06.101
We got a little under
eight hours and 20 minutes to go

00:14:06.168 --> 00:14:07.972
before the F.S.D.F. boards us.

00:14:08.039 --> 00:14:10.443
Boss wanted me
to crank up the time again

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.680
at the eight-hour mark,

00:14:11.746 --> 00:14:13.950
but since the other players
got wiped out,

00:14:14.017 --> 00:14:15.954
might as well do it now.

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:19.494
Whatever you’re up to in there,
Vassago, you better hang on.

00:14:21.733 --> 00:14:23.435
- ( gasps )
- ( lever clunks )

00:14:23.503 --> 00:14:24.972
What the...

00:14:26.075 --> 00:14:28.312
That figures. I need a key.

00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:29.782
Eh?

00:14:29.849 --> 00:14:31.553
Brigg: We’re good
at pickin’ locks.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.990
Rinko: Higa, hey!

00:14:34.057 --> 00:14:37.397
Can you hear me?!
Come on! Wake up!

00:14:37.463 --> 00:14:38.332
( Higa gasps )

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.302
( groaning )

00:14:42.542 --> 00:14:44.512
H-How’s Kirito?

00:14:44.578 --> 00:14:46.082
Rinko: He’s out of danger.

00:14:46.148 --> 00:14:48.753
His Fluctlight activity’s
been fully restored.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.291
It’s a little too active,
to be honest.

00:14:51.358 --> 00:14:54.331
Higa: Really?
Oh, that’s good to hear.

00:14:54.397 --> 00:14:55.868
Kikuoka: I swear, Higa,

00:14:55.935 --> 00:14:58.072
you had me scared
for a second there.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:01.078
I’m sorry. It’s all my fault
that mole got onboard.

00:15:01.145 --> 00:15:03.082
I should’ve vetted
the staff better.

00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:04.752
Higa: It’s okay, Keeks.

00:15:04.819 --> 00:15:06.956
What about Alice
and the Underworld?

00:15:07.023 --> 00:15:08.359
Kikuoka:
They’re both safe for now.

00:15:08.426 --> 00:15:10.496
All the players
from the U.S., China,

00:15:10.564 --> 00:15:12.333
and South Korea
have logged out.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.042
Higa: W-Wait.
China and South Korea?

00:15:16.108 --> 00:15:18.078
They had people
logged in from there, too?

00:15:18.145 --> 00:15:19.682
Rinko: Yeah, tons of ’em.

00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:21.786
They posted
all over social media

00:15:21.853 --> 00:15:23.723
using their competitiveness
as gamers

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.894
to rile ’em up and lure ’em in.

00:15:25.961 --> 00:15:28.834
Higa: Uh-huh. That would do it.

00:15:28.901 --> 00:15:30.971
Kirito: The 2,000
from Japan you logged in

00:15:31.037 --> 00:15:33.877
put up a good fight,
but they were mostly wiped out.

00:15:33.944 --> 00:15:35.246
At that point, there were still

00:15:35.313 --> 00:15:38.853
over 20,000 Chinese
and South Korean players left.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.791
Luckily,
that’s when Kirito woke up,

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:43.029
- and just like that--
- ( alarm blaring )

00:15:43.096 --> 00:15:44.364
Kikuoka: Oh, my God.

00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:50.043
Critter: That’s not good!

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.447
Computer: Fluctlight
Acceleration rate

00:15:52.515 --> 00:15:54.485
safety limiter disengaged.

00:15:54.552 --> 00:15:58.159
15 minutes until
maximum-acceleration phase.

00:15:58.226 --> 00:15:59.929
For personnel in the S.T.L.s,

00:15:59.996 --> 00:16:02.233
initiate disengagement
protocol immediately.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.169
Higa: Crap.

00:16:03.236 --> 00:16:05.272
Rinko: Maximum
acceleration phase?

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.914
Isn’t the F.L.A. rate limited
to 1,200 times normal speed?

00:16:08.981 --> 00:16:10.483
Higa: Only for folks diving.

00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:11.986
1,200’s the limit

00:16:12.053 --> 00:16:14.559
for the life span
of a real-world human soul,

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:17.130
but for observing,
we can’t speed it up

00:16:17.197 --> 00:16:19.367
more than 5,000 times normal.

00:16:19.434 --> 00:16:22.073
That said, the hardware
can go even faster.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.610
Rinko: But how fast?

00:16:23.677 --> 00:16:25.446
The hardware
does have a limit,

00:16:25.514 --> 00:16:26.516
doesn’t it?

00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:28.853
Higa: During
the maximum-acceleration phase,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.626
the F.L.A. rate
will be just over five million.

00:16:31.693 --> 00:16:35.032
The two S.T.L.s in Roppongi
can’t keep up at that speed,

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:36.268
’cause they’re on a SAT-link.

00:16:36.335 --> 00:16:38.473
They’ll be disconnected
automatically.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.445
But Kirito’s and Asuna’s
S.T.L.s are hard-wired.

00:16:41.513 --> 00:16:43.415
Rinko: They’re in danger!
Come on!

00:16:43.482 --> 00:16:46.021
We have to get them
out of those S.T.L.s right now be--

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:47.324
Higa: No! We can’t!

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.529
The initial acceleration phase
already started.

00:16:49.596 --> 00:16:51.799
If we pull ’em out
of those machines now,

00:16:51.866 --> 00:16:53.235
it’ll damage
their Fluctlights!

00:16:53.302 --> 00:16:54.906
Rinko: What about
the disengagement protocol?

00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:57.176
Can we start that?!

00:16:57.243 --> 00:17:00.216
Higa: Hey, Keeks, I’m going back
to the maintenance connector.

00:17:00.283 --> 00:17:02.755
Kikuoka: Understood,
but I’m going to go with you.

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:04.123
I think
I should be strong enough

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.995
to carry you
down that ladder on my back.

00:17:06.061 --> 00:17:07.130
Nakanishi: It’s too risky!

00:17:07.197 --> 00:17:09.068
Please, sir, let me take him!

00:17:09.134 --> 00:17:10.370
Kikuoka: No. I need you

00:17:10.436 --> 00:17:12.473
and the other agents
to defend the stairs.

00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:15.146
We have to open
the bulkhead again,

00:17:15.212 --> 00:17:17.483
which means you’ll have
to engage the enemy directly,

00:17:17.551 --> 00:17:19.555
which means the risk
is greater for you.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:22.393
I’m sorry, but that’s
the way it has to be.

00:17:24.164 --> 00:17:25.299
Nakanishi: Sir, yes, sir.

00:17:27.738 --> 00:17:29.007
( Higa gasps )

00:17:29.074 --> 00:17:30.309
Wait a sec!

00:17:30.376 --> 00:17:32.447
When I was operating
the S.T.L.s before,

00:17:32.514 --> 00:17:35.554
I set us up with an open channel
to talk to Kirito!

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:38.693
He’s on line C-12!
Hurry up, and call him now!

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.862
Kikuoka: What do I tell him?

00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:42.099
Higa: Tell him
to log himself out!

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.810
Asuna: Is Alice safe?
Can you tell?

00:17:46.877 --> 00:17:48.379
Kirito: She hasn’t
been caught yet,

00:17:48.446 --> 00:17:51.418
but there’s
a massive presence chasing her.

00:17:51.485 --> 00:17:52.688
Asuna: Oh, boy.

00:17:52.755 --> 00:17:56.328
I hope we can catch up to her
before it’s too late.

00:17:56.395 --> 00:17:57.532
- Kikuoka: Kirito!
- ( Kirito winces )

00:17:57.598 --> 00:17:59.502
Kikuoka: Can you hear me?

00:17:59.568 --> 00:18:00.904
Kirito, come in!

00:18:00.971 --> 00:18:03.810
Kirito: Kikuoka?
How am I hearing you?

00:18:03.877 --> 00:18:05.279
I-I’m not at a console.

00:18:05.346 --> 00:18:07.284
Kikuoka: Never mind that.
Just listen.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.887
You’re in a lot of danger.

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:11.258
The time acceleration rate
is increasing,

00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:13.496
because the hijackers
disengaged the F.L.A. limiter!

00:18:13.564 --> 00:18:14.632
Kirito: The limiter?

00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:16.836
Kikuoka: Higa says
if you’re still in there

00:18:16.903 --> 00:18:18.906
when we reach
maximum acceleration,

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:21.011
by the time
we disconnect you here,

00:18:21.077 --> 00:18:22.715
200 years
will have passed there.

00:18:22.781 --> 00:18:24.585
Kirito: What?!

00:18:24.652 --> 00:18:26.590
Kikuoka: You and Asuna
have ten minutes

00:18:26.656 --> 00:18:28.960
to reach the console
and log out manually.

00:18:29.027 --> 00:18:30.797
Depleting your HP
is another option,

00:18:30.864 --> 00:18:32.133
but it’s too risky.

00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:35.240
If you die after we reach
maximum acceleration,

00:18:35.306 --> 00:18:37.143
you’ll spend 200 years
in the Underworld

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.414
in a state
of total sensory deprivation!

00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:41.352
Kirito: Got it.
Me and Asuna are headed

00:18:41.418 --> 00:18:43.221
for the console
at the World’s End Altar.

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:45.025
I’ll catch up to Alice in a bit,

00:18:45.092 --> 00:18:48.098
so get ready.
We’re bringing her, too.

00:18:48.165 --> 00:18:51.404
Kikuoka: Thanks,
but you two are more important.

00:18:51.471 --> 00:18:55.313
I want you to prioritize
your escape over securing Alice.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.720
200 years is longer than
the life span of a human soul.

00:18:58.786 --> 00:19:00.757
So even though
we can delete your memories

00:19:00.824 --> 00:19:02.093
after logging you out,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.964
if you’ve been
in there that long,

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.700
the odds of you
regaining consciousness here

00:19:05.767 --> 00:19:07.169
would be almost zero!

00:19:08.506 --> 00:19:10.109
Kirito: Don’t worry.
We’ll make it.

00:19:10.176 --> 00:19:11.411
We’ll all make it.

00:19:11.478 --> 00:19:13.316
Uh, oh, and one more thing.

00:19:13.382 --> 00:19:15.520
I’m sorry, you know,

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:17.490
for calling you
a son of a bitch.

00:19:17.558 --> 00:19:19.629
Kikuoka: Not at all.
I deserved it,

00:19:19.696 --> 00:19:22.267
and you can punch me
when you get back.

00:19:22.334 --> 00:19:24.672
Looks like Higa’s ready.

00:19:24.739 --> 00:19:26.809
I have to go. Good luck.

00:19:26.876 --> 00:19:27.845
Kirito: You, too.

00:19:27.911 --> 00:19:29.615
We’ll get to that console.

00:19:29.682 --> 00:19:31.418
See you in ten.

00:19:31.484 --> 00:19:35.594
Asuna: What did he say?
You sounded like it was serious.

00:19:35.661 --> 00:19:37.130
Is it? Well, is it?

00:19:37.197 --> 00:19:38.498
Kirito: Not really.

00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:41.138
The time here’s
gonna speed up in ten minutes.

00:19:41.205 --> 00:19:44.178
He wants us
to log out before it does.

00:19:44.244 --> 00:19:45.345
Asuna: All right, then.

00:19:45.412 --> 00:19:47.117
I wish we could
float here forever,

00:19:47.183 --> 00:19:48.754
but Alice does need us.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.256
Come on. Let’s go get her.

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:53.328
Kirito: Hang on.
We’ll be goin’ fast.

Alice: Amayori and Takiguri,

00:20:17.945 --> 00:20:20.584
this is my final order to you.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:24.658
Return to the Human Empire
and your nests in the West.

00:20:24.725 --> 00:20:26.862
Amayori, find a husband,

00:20:26.929 --> 00:20:29.067
and, Takiguri, find a wife.

00:20:29.134 --> 00:20:32.039
Have many babies,
and raise them to be strong,

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:34.344
strong and brave,
so that one day,

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.551
they may carry knights
as gallantly as their parents.
