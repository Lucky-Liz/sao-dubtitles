00:10:05.817 --> 00:10:07.722
And since humans
are social creatures,

00:10:07.788 --> 00:10:09.490
not isolated individuals,

00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:11.696
you have an image
of others in your mind,

00:10:11.762 --> 00:10:13.733
and they have one of you
in theirs.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.904
It’s like we’re all connected
up to a point

00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:17.641
in a kind of network,
if you will.

00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:20.480
Wouldn’t you agree?

00:10:20.547 --> 00:10:23.719
Higa: The image of me
in others?

00:10:23.786 --> 00:10:24.721
It’s like a...

00:10:25.857 --> 00:10:27.828
a backup of the self-image!

00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:30.232
That’s it! We got it!

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:33.873
We can restore his subjective
self-image! We have the data!

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.014
It’s in the Fluctlights
of the people he’s closest to!

00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:43.191
All right, if we wanna extract
that data, we need an S.T.L.,

00:10:43.258 --> 00:10:46.065
and reproducing it’ll take
more than one person.

00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:49.170
We’re gonna need two--
no, three people.

00:10:49.237 --> 00:10:52.678
Hey, Keeks, the girls
diving from Roppongi,

00:10:52.745 --> 00:10:55.583
how tight are they with Kirito?
Are they close?

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.019
Kikuoka: Yeah, they both are.

00:10:57.086 --> 00:11:00.459
You heard about the Death Gun
case six months ago.

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:02.864
Well, Sinon helped Kirito
crack that one.

00:11:02.931 --> 00:11:05.804
And Leafa is Kirito’s
little sister.

00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:07.507
Higa: This’ll work!

00:11:07.574 --> 00:11:09.945
We got what we need
to save Kirito!

00:11:10.012 --> 00:11:12.016
We can restore his self-image!

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:14.555
We’ll extract the image of him
stored in their Fluctlights

00:11:14.622 --> 00:11:16.693
and connect it
to the damaged regions.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.963
That should repair
his subjective self!

00:11:20.332 --> 00:11:22.136
Hot damn, this is gonna work!

00:11:22.203 --> 00:11:25.275
( gasps ) Oh, no!
What am I saying?

00:11:25.342 --> 00:11:26.712
This won’t work!

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:29.183
The equipment
I need to run everything

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.254
is in the main
friggin’ control room!

00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:32.691
( Rinko gasps )

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:35.063
Kikuoka: Don’t beat
yourself up, Higa.

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:37.601
We have a better shot
at restoring Kirito now,

00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:40.941
and that’s good.
But for now, we wait.

00:11:41.008 --> 00:11:43.680
Once our guests leave and
the Ocean Turtle’s ours again,

00:11:43.747 --> 00:11:44.682
we’ll get to work.

00:11:44.748 --> 00:11:45.884
Higa: That’ll be too late!

00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:47.655
We have to do it now.

00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:50.225
If the "Asahi"
sends commandos to board us

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:53.232
and they end up fighting
the hijackers in the Main Shaft,

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:55.871
it could knock out
the power in SubCon.

00:11:55.938 --> 00:11:58.976
If that happens,
Kirito’s S.T.L. would shut down,

00:11:59.043 --> 00:12:02.651
and he’d be logged out
of the Underworld unconscious.

00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:04.822
In that state,
we’d never get him

00:12:04.888 --> 00:12:06.859
to pass
the initialization stage,

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:09.798
and he’ll never be able
to connect to the S.T.L. again.

00:12:10.934 --> 00:12:13.740
We can’t wait. We have to try

00:12:13.807 --> 00:12:16.344
now, right now,
while he and those girls

00:12:16.411 --> 00:12:17.514
are still in the Underworld.

00:12:17.581 --> 00:12:20.319
It’s our only shot
at saving him.

00:12:21.722 --> 00:12:24.762
I’ll do it, Keeks. I’ll go.

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:27.132
Kikuoka: I don’t follow.
Where are you going?

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:29.271
Higa: All right, here’s my plan.

00:12:29.337 --> 00:12:30.974
There’s a cable duct

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:33.379
running down the stern side
of the Main Shaft.

00:12:33.445 --> 00:12:36.919
It connects S.T.L. 2,
Kirito’s room, to Main Con.

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:38.856
I’m gonna climb down the duct

00:12:38.923 --> 00:12:40.159
’til I get
to the maintenance connector.

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:42.296
I’ll patch in to it,
and I should be able

00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:45.837
to control Kirito’s S.T.L.
from there.

00:12:45.904 --> 00:12:47.207
Kikuoka: But that connector is

00:12:47.273 --> 00:12:49.878
on the same side of the bulkhead
as the hijackers.

00:12:49.945 --> 00:12:51.616
If they find out
you’re in the duct,

00:12:51.683 --> 00:12:53.886
they’ll breach it
and attack you from below.

00:12:53.953 --> 00:12:55.890
Higa: Right,
so I’ll need a decoy.

00:12:55.957 --> 00:12:58.262
Kikuoka: Yes, you do, but who?

00:12:58.328 --> 00:12:59.932
Higa: Not "who?"

00:12:59.998 --> 00:13:02.436
I wouldn’t want anyone here
to risk their life, too.

00:13:02.504 --> 00:13:04.007
We’ll unlock the bulkhead door,

00:13:04.074 --> 00:13:06.044
then send some thing
that can’t get killed

00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:08.950
on a walk downstairs
to Main Con, him.

00:13:11.756 --> 00:13:13.258
Kikuoka: Oh, I get it.

00:13:15.062 --> 00:13:16.231
Ichiemon.

00:13:16.298 --> 00:13:17.500
Rinko: Your robot?!

00:13:17.568 --> 00:13:18.937
But all it can do is walk.

00:13:19.003 --> 00:13:21.475
It can’t fight or run
or anything else.

00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:22.711
Once they see him coming,

00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:24.080
they’re just
gonna blow it to pieces,

00:13:24.146 --> 00:13:25.717
and that’s the end of that.

00:13:25.784 --> 00:13:27.419
Higa: It sucks for Ichiemon,

00:13:27.486 --> 00:13:29.023
but he’s the best decoy we have.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.328
Besides, with how he looks,

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:34.200
they might think he’ll explode
if they shoot him.

00:13:34.267 --> 00:13:36.939
( Rinko sighs ) Well, he’ll
definitely get their attention.

00:13:37.006 --> 00:13:38.909
That’s for sure.
At the very least,

00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:40.914
they might think
we sent him down there

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.352
because we’re planning
something even more ridiculous.

00:13:43.418 --> 00:13:46.224
Higa: They can’t ignore him.
That’s the point of sending him.

00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:48.930
Then while the hijackers
are dealing with Ichiemon,

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:51.434
I’ll climb into the lower part
of the duct,

00:13:51.502 --> 00:13:52.871
patch into that connector,

00:13:52.938 --> 00:13:55.309
and operate Kirito’s S.T.L.
from there.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:56.879
Kikuoka: We have two robots.

00:13:56.946 --> 00:14:00.052
Hmm. We should send Niemon.

00:14:00.119 --> 00:14:03.291
Higa: Nope. Like I told Asuna
before this nightmare started,

00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:04.528
he’s not ready yet.

00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:07.066
He needs a Fluctlight to pilot
and keep him in balance,

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:09.137
or he’ll just roll
down the stairs.

00:14:09.203 --> 00:14:10.206
Kikuoka: Damn.

00:14:10.273 --> 00:14:14.080
Rinko: Higa,
I’m not so sure about this.

00:14:14.147 --> 00:14:17.086
Even if the decoy works,
when you’re in that duct,

00:14:17.153 --> 00:14:20.159
you’re vulnerable, and if
they find you in there...

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:22.965
You should take an agent to keep
an eye out while you work.

00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:25.837
Higa: No way. The J.S.D.F. agents
have to stay here

00:14:25.904 --> 00:14:27.507
to keep all of you safe.

00:14:27.574 --> 00:14:28.910
Besides, the duct

00:14:28.977 --> 00:14:30.947
is way too narrow
for most folks to fit,

00:14:31.014 --> 00:14:34.287
but not for
a skinny little nerd like me!

00:14:34.354 --> 00:14:37.728
Don’t you worry. I’ll be down
and back before you know it.

00:14:37.795 --> 00:14:41.001
Kirito risked everything
for this project.

00:14:41.067 --> 00:14:43.171
If it weren’t for him,
Alice’s Fluctlight

00:14:43.238 --> 00:14:45.342
wouldn’t have developed
into what it is.

00:14:45.409 --> 00:14:49.450
He tried to protect her.
That’s why he’s in this mess.

00:14:49.518 --> 00:14:53.125
And that’s why,
if there’s a chance to save him,

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:56.732
I have to take it. Doesn’t
matter if I’m risking my life.

00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:59.003
It’s the only way
I can make it up to him.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.205
- ( Kikuoka grunts )
- ( Higa gasps )

00:15:00.272 --> 00:15:01.408
( chuckles )

00:15:01.475 --> 00:15:02.978
Man: Um...

00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:04.447
if you don’t mind,

00:15:04.515 --> 00:15:06.952
I’d like to go with you
and be your bodyguard.

00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:09.992
I’m pretty skinny myself,

00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:11.728
but there’s enough meat
on my bones

00:15:11.795 --> 00:15:14.133
to stop a bullet
if it comes to that.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.572
I’m also the one in charge
of cable maintenance here,

00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:19.411
so I could be useful.

00:15:19.477 --> 00:15:22.016
Higa: Uh, to be honest,

00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:25.489
I’m not 100% sure
how far down that connector is.

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:28.395
If you’re okay with it,
I could use the help.

00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:29.965
Thanks, Yanai.

00:15:30.938 --> 00:15:32.675
( wind blowing )

00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:35.014
( weapons slicing )

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.393
( Bercouli growls )

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.597
( chorus vocalizing )

00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:51.680
( wound squelches )

00:15:56.524 --> 00:15:57.925
( Bercouli growls )

00:15:59.362 --> 00:16:01.066
- ( groans )
- Gabriel: How boring.

00:16:02.401 --> 00:16:04.706
Your soul is
too thick and heavy,

00:16:04.773 --> 00:16:07.611
too simple.
It sticks to my tongue.

00:16:08.848 --> 00:16:12.121
All you can think about
is killing me.

00:16:12.188 --> 00:16:14.092
And now you are done.

00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:17.665
( Bercouli laughs )
That’s what you think.

00:16:19.703 --> 00:16:21.573
I still got some life in me!

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.444
( chorus vocalizing )

00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:25.815
Just a little longer.

00:16:25.882 --> 00:16:26.916
( groans )

00:16:29.222 --> 00:16:31.559
Where is it? Where’d it go?

00:16:32.962 --> 00:16:33.764
Over there?

00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:37.104
- ( groans )
- Gabriel: Hmm?

00:16:39.943 --> 00:16:40.678
( Bercouli grunts )

00:16:41.947 --> 00:16:44.519
No. Was it that way?

00:16:46.157 --> 00:16:47.858
Thirty seconds left.

00:16:47.925 --> 00:16:49.796
( panting )

00:16:52.268 --> 00:16:53.804
There.

00:16:53.871 --> 00:16:54.873
( energy whines )

00:16:54.939 --> 00:16:56.142
Found it.

00:16:56.209 --> 00:16:59.783
579, 580...

00:16:59.849 --> 00:17:02.622
581, 582!

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.627
Gabriel: Now, what could
you possibly be up to?

00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:10.471
( Bercouli groans )

00:17:10.538 --> 00:17:13.043
I missed, damn it.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.483
Forgive me, Asuna and Alice.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.785
He got me.

00:17:22.294 --> 00:17:24.999
( gasps )

00:17:25.067 --> 00:17:27.872
Hey, I thought
I told you to go back.

00:17:27.938 --> 00:17:29.075
Gabriel: Huh?

00:17:31.513 --> 00:17:32.816
( grunts )

00:17:32.882 --> 00:17:36.156
Bercouli: This is the first time
you disobeyed me.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.961
( chuckles ) Stubborn old dragon

00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:40.931
( Hoshigami roaring )

00:17:47.812 --> 00:17:50.384
- ( Gabriel gasps )
- Bercouli: Hoshigami...

00:17:50.451 --> 00:17:53.190
thanks for giving me
one more chance.

00:17:53.257 --> 00:17:55.094
I won’t waste it!

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.830
- ( chorus vocalizing )
- ( Hoshigami growls )

00:18:03.144 --> 00:18:04.912
( Bercouli yelling )

00:18:10.658 --> 00:18:13.931
( ticking )
