and needed a break,

I am sure he had
his reservations.

Through my actions,

00:09:42.652 --> 00:09:44.889
I proved to him
the depth of my conviction,

00:09:44.922 --> 00:09:46.627
and I am sure in the end,

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.131

in this world,

to protect countless others.

00:10:06.198 --> 00:10:08.002
