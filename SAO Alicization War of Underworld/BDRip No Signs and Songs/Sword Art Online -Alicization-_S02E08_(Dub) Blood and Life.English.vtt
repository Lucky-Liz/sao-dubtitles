THERE WAS A LACK
OF SPATIAL POWER,

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:33.178
AND WE COULDN’T CONJURE
OUR INCINERATION PROJECTILES,

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:36.284

LAUNCHED A LARGE-SCALE ATTACK.

A MASSIVE FORMAL ART

AND DRAINED ALL
THE SPATIAL POWER IN THE RAVINE!

HAS COLLECTED IN THE RAVINE.

00:03:07.382 --> 00:03:09.119
WE MUST CONSUME IT
WITH HEALING ARTS

00:03:09.186 --> 00:03:11.992
BEFORE THE ENEMY CAN ABSORB IT.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.898

HAS BEEN DEPLETED!

00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:28.491
AND KEEP WATCH
FOR ENEMY MOVEMENT!

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.798
I WILL GO AND
GIVE MY REPORT TO THE COMMANDER.

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:33.201
WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT HERE?

00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:34.169

WITHOUT YOU, AMAYORI.

Eldrie: NO.
NOTHING MAJOR, AT LEAST.

00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:06.902
