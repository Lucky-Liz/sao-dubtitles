00:10:35.148 --> 00:10:38.020
NO MATTER HOW WE
TRULY FEEL ABOUT THEM...

00:10:39.323 --> 00:10:41.260
WE CAN’T SAY WE LOVE THEM!

00:10:49.778 --> 00:10:51.615
Alice: IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:53.451
YOU’VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:56.157
Ronie: BUT WE HAVE!

00:10:56.224 --> 00:10:59.564
YOU’RE A NOBLE INTEGRITY KNIGHT,
SO YOU CAN’T UNDERSTAND!

00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:01.267
WE’RE SINNERS!

00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:04.675
WE CAUSED BLOODSHED
BY LETTING OURSELVES BE DEFILED!

00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:07.146
Alice: THE BODY
IS NOTHING MORE THAN A VESSEL.

00:11:07.213 --> 00:11:11.722
YOUR HEART, YOUR SOUL
IS WHO YOU REALLY ARE,

00:11:11.789 --> 00:11:14.427
AND YOU DETERMINE
THE NATURE OF YOUR SOUL,

00:11:14.494 --> 00:11:16.430
YOU, AND YOU ALONE.

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:20.071

THE PERSON YOU REALLY ARE

00:11:47.994 --> 00:11:50.298
IS BUT THE REFLECTION
OF YOUR HEART,

00:11:50.365 --> 00:11:52.436
AND THAT CANNOT BE DEFILED.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:55.242
I WAS BORN IN A TINY VILLAGE.

00:11:55.308 --> 00:11:58.749
I SHOULD HAVE GROWN UP
TO BECOME WHO YOU SEE NOW,

00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:02.590
BUT WHEN I WAS JUST A CHILD,
I WAS ARRESTED FOR A CRIME.

00:12:02.657 --> 00:12:03.860
MY MEMORIES WERE ERASED,

00:12:03.926 --> 00:12:06.397
AND I WAS TURNED INTO
AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT.

00:12:06.464 --> 00:12:08.969
THERE WERE TIMES
I CURSED MY FATE.

00:12:09.036 --> 00:12:12.543
HOWEVER, KIRITO TAUGHT ME
TO OVERCOME IT,

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.912
THAT I HAD THE POWER TO.

00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:15.617
I JUST HAD TO WILL IT,

00:12:15.683 --> 00:12:17.554
AND I WON’T DOUBT MYSELF AGAIN.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.160
I’VE CHOSEN TO ACCEPT WHO I AM
AND MOVE ON.

00:12:25.435 --> 00:12:27.072
I AM SURE, GIVEN TIME,

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:31.615
THE TWO OF YOU WILL ALSO
FIND YOUR WAY AND FIND PEACE.

00:12:31.682 --> 00:12:34.386
( both crying )

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.906
( birds chirping )

00:12:45.979 --> 00:12:46.915
Bercouli: HEY.

00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:48.585
Alice: UNCLE.

00:12:48.652 --> 00:12:51.290
- GOOD MORNING.
- ( Bercouli grunts )

00:12:51.357 --> 00:12:53.528
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND JUST NOW

00:12:53.595 --> 00:12:56.133
AND WHAT TO DO WITH HIM
WHEN THE FIGHTING STARTS.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.237
Alice: I HAVE ALREADY
MADE ARRANGEMENTS.

00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:00.209
LAST NIGHT, I WAS PAID A VISIT

00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:02.646
BY HIS FORMER PAGES
FROM THE ACADEMY.

00:13:02.712 --> 00:13:05.118
I TRUST THEM, SO I ASKED THEM
TO LOOK AFTER KIRITO.

00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:07.122
Bercouli: GOOD.
GLAD THAT’S SETTLED.

00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:09.593
BY THE WAY,
HOW’D THE KID TAKE IT?

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.764
DID SEEING
THESE FOLKS FROM HIS PAST

00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:13.835
SNAP HIM OUT OF HIS FOG ANY?

00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:14.837
Alice: MM-MMM.

00:13:14.904 --> 00:13:17.076
Bercouli: OH, WELL. CHIN UP.

00:13:17.142 --> 00:13:19.947
SOMETHING TELLS ME HE’LL
COME AROUND AND, WHEN HE DOES,

00:13:20.014 --> 00:13:22.620
HE’LL BE THE ONE
WHO SETS THE COURSE OF THIS WAR.

00:13:22.686 --> 00:13:24.923
- Alice: HMM?
- Bercouli: EVEN IF HE GOT HELP

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.762
FROM YOU AND HIS PARTNER,
KILLING THE PRIME SENATOR

00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:30.202
AND THE PONTIFEX
WAS ANYTHING BUT EASY.

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:32.205
IF I TOOK HIM ON,

00:13:32.272 --> 00:13:35.078
I DOUBT I’D LAST
AGAINST HIS INCARNATE ABILITY.

00:13:35.145 --> 00:13:37.149
( Alice gasps )
YOU EXAGGERATE.

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.620
Bercouli: YESTERDAY,
WHEN OUR WILLS CLASHED,

00:13:39.687 --> 00:13:42.392
I DEFINITELY FELT IT.
THAT KID’S GOT EQUAL

00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:46.568
OR, HELL, EVEN MORE EXPERIENCE
IN REAL COMBAT THAN ME.

00:13:46.634 --> 00:13:48.905
Alice: BUT HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

00:13:48.972 --> 00:13:50.409
YOU ARE MUCH OLDER.

00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:51.678
Bercouli: NOT IN EXPERIENCE.

00:13:51.744 --> 00:13:54.716
- HE’S GOT WAY MORE.
- ( Alice gasps )

00:13:54.783 --> 00:13:57.323
Bercouli: THE TABOO INDEX
FORBIDS BATTLES TO THE DEATH,

00:13:57.389 --> 00:14:00.095
BUT HE’S GOT
TONS OF EXPERIENCE WITH THAT.

00:14:00.162 --> 00:14:01.864
QUESTION IS, HOW?

00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:04.070
Alice: UNCLE, HE IS NOT FROM--

00:14:04.137 --> 00:14:05.405

AFTER OUR MEETING, I WOULD
LIKE TO SEE HIM FOR A MOMENT.

IT WON’T TAKE LONG.

00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:42.947

EVEN THOUGH HE DEFEATED ME,

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:47.923
HE FOUGHT HONORABLY.
TRUTH BE TOLD,

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.363
THAT BOY IS THE ONLY MALE
WHO FOUGHT ME WITH ALL HE HAD.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.501
IT DID NOT MATTER TO HIM
IN THE SLIGHTEST

00:14:53.568 --> 00:14:55.238
THAT I HAPPENED TO BE A WOMAN.

00:14:55.305 --> 00:14:57.409
Alice: WHY WOULD THAT MATTER?

00:14:57.475 --> 00:15:00.582
Fanatio: WHEN I FIRST BECAME
A KNIGHT AND FOUGHT WITH MEN,

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:03.155
I COULD TELL THEY HELD BACK,

00:15:03.221 --> 00:15:04.824
SO I DONNED THIS HELMET

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.029
AND MASTERED THE ART
OF CONTINUOUS ATTACKS

00:15:07.096 --> 00:15:10.169
TO PREVENT MY OPPONENTS
FROM GETTING TOO CLOSE.

00:15:10.235 --> 00:15:12.773
ULTIMATELY THE REAL ISSUE

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:15.112
WAS THAT I WAS SELF-CONSCIOUS
ABOUT MY GENDER.

00:15:15.178 --> 00:15:17.149
HE SAW RIGHT THROUGH ME, THOUGH,

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:19.953
AND FOUGHT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT,
REGARDLESS.

00:15:20.021 --> 00:15:22.626
I UNLEASHED ALL
OF MY SWORD TECHNIQUES AND ARTS,

00:15:22.692 --> 00:15:24.497
AND HE STILL BESTED ME.

00:15:24.564 --> 00:15:25.999
THEN AFTER I HEALED,

00:15:26.066 --> 00:15:29.673
MY PETTY OBSESSION
HAD DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.216
THERE! NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY I AM SO EAGER TO THANK HIM?

00:15:34.283 --> 00:15:36.754
I AM ALSO A TAD VEXED,
TO BE HONEST.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.193
MY FEMININITY DID NOT REGISTER
WITH HIM AT ALL

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.230
ONCE HE SAW MY FACE.

00:15:41.297 --> 00:15:43.735
I THOUGHT IF I SAW HIM,
I COULD...

00:15:43.801 --> 00:15:46.941
TRY A FEW THINGS THAT
MIGHT STIMULATE HIS RECOVERY.

00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:47.743
( Alice gasps )

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.847
I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOUR CONCERN,

00:15:49.913 --> 00:15:51.784
BUT HE IS RESTING
AT THE MOMENT.

00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:53.888
I WILL MAKE SURE
TO GIVE HIM YOUR REGARDS

00:15:53.955 --> 00:15:56.594
- WHEN I CHECK ON HIM LATER.
- Fanatio: OH.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.433
IT SEEMS YOU’VE INSTALLED
YOURSELF AS HIS GUARDIAN.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.738
WELL, WHENEVER
THE COMMANDER WAS ON DUTY

00:16:01.804 --> 00:16:03.474
AND YOU WISHED
TO SPEAK WITH HIM,

00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:06.547
I NEVER REFUSED YOU,
NOT EVEN ONCE.

00:16:06.614 --> 00:16:08.585
Alice: I DO NOT
NEED YOUR PERMISSION.

00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:11.023
I CAN SEE HIM ANY TIME I CHOOSE.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.626
AND ANOTHER THING,

00:16:12.692 --> 00:16:15.532
IF YOU TRULY WISHED TO BE
BEATEN SENSELESS BY A MALE,

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:18.137
SURELY UNCLE HERE
COULD HAVE OBLIGED YOU.

00:16:18.204 --> 00:16:19.774
Fanatio: I WOULD
NOT EXPECT HIM TO.

00:16:19.841 --> 00:16:22.045
HE IS THE STRONGEST SWORDSMAN
IN THE LAND.

00:16:22.112 --> 00:16:24.116
HE WOULD NOT SPAR
WITH HIS KNIGHTS FULL-BORE.

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:26.687
- ( Bercouli groans )
- Alice: OH, YOU DON’T SAY?

00:16:26.754 --> 00:16:28.691
WELL, WHENEVER I
TRAINED WITH HIM,

00:16:28.758 --> 00:16:31.997
HE WAS ALWAYS DRENCHED IN SWEAT
FROM THE EXERTION.

00:16:32.065 --> 00:16:33.435
( Fanatio laughs )

00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:34.837
- IS WHAT SHE SAYS TRUE...
- Alice: UNCLE...

00:16:34.903 --> 00:16:36.073
- Fanatio: COMMAND--
- Alice: SET THIS WOMAN STRAI--

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.543
Bercouli: COME ON!

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.914
IT’S TIME
WE GOT THIS MEETING STARTED.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.152
( both gasp )

00:16:42.218 --> 00:16:43.788
( both sigh )

00:16:43.854 --> 00:16:46.661
Fanatio: WE HAVE CONSIDERED
MANY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

00:16:46.728 --> 00:16:49.199
OVER THE PAST FOUR MONTHS
AND HAVE CONCLUDED THAT,

00:16:49.266 --> 00:16:50.568
AT OUR CURRENT STRENGTH,

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.341
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT
TO REPEL AN ALL-OUT ATTACK.

00:16:53.408 --> 00:16:55.812
ON OUR SIDE
OF THE END MOUNTAINS,

00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:58.651
THERE IS NOTHING
BUT GRASSLAND AND ROCKS

00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:01.190
FOR TEN KILORS
IN ALL DIRECTIONS.

00:17:01.257 --> 00:17:02.859
IF THE ENEMY
ADVANCES THIS FAR,

00:17:02.926 --> 00:17:05.698
WE WILL BE SURROUNDED
AND SLAUGHTERED.

00:17:05.765 --> 00:17:09.974
OUR ONLY OPTION IS TO ENGAGE
THEM IN THIS NARROW RAVINE,

00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:13.681
WHICH IS ONE HUNDRED MELS WIDE
AND ONE THOUSAND MELS LONG.

00:17:13.748 --> 00:17:15.785
WE WILL SET UP
A DEFENSIVE POSITION HERE,

00:17:15.852 --> 00:17:17.957
ABSORB THEIR CHARGE,
AND GRIND THEM DOWN.

00:17:18.024 --> 00:17:20.828
THIS WILL BE THE BASIC THRUST
OF OUR STRATEGY.

00:17:20.895 --> 00:17:22.866
DOES ANYONE HAVE
ANY THOUGHTS SO FAR?

00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:26.473
Eldrie: I HAVE A CONCERN.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.778
THE ENEMY
HAS OGRES AND LONGBOWS

00:17:28.845 --> 00:17:32.019
AND, EVEN MORE DANGEROUS,
DARK MAGES OF UNTOLD NUMBERS.

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:34.657
HOW CAN WE COUNTERACT
THEIR LONG-RANGE ATTACKS?

00:17:34.723 --> 00:17:37.229
Fanatio: I HAVE AN IDEA ON THAT.

00:17:37.296 --> 00:17:39.767
( Alice gasps )

00:17:39.834 --> 00:17:42.005
Fanatio: THERE IS
NO SUNLIGHT IN THAT RAVINE,

00:17:42.072 --> 00:17:43.208
EVEN DURING THE DAY.

00:17:43.274 --> 00:17:45.011
NOT EVEN THE GRASS GROWS.

00:17:45.078 --> 00:17:47.816
SACRED POWER
IS SPARSE THERE, AT BEST.

00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:50.221
BUT IN THEORY,
IF WE ABSORB THE POWER

00:17:50.288 --> 00:17:51.891
FROM THE BATTLEFIELD FIRST,

00:17:51.957 --> 00:17:54.663
THEIR MAGES WON’T BE ABLE
TO USE IT TO ATTACK US.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.167
( officers gasp )

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.838
Fanatio: THE SAME IS TRUE
FOR OUR SIDE AS WELL.

00:17:58.905 --> 00:18:02.879
AT THE PRESENT, WE ONLY HAVE
100 WHO CAN WIELD THE ARTS.

00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:06.454
IF WE ALLOW THE BATTLE TO COME
DOWN TO OUR WIELDERS AND THEIRS,

00:18:06.521 --> 00:18:08.725
THEIRS WILL USE FAR MORE POWER.

00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:11.931
Deusolbert: THE ARTS ARE NOT
JUST USED FOR COMBAT, THOUGH.

00:18:11.998 --> 00:18:14.736
IF ALL THE SACRED POWER
IS EXHAUSTED,

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.840
HEALING THE LIVES
OF OUR CRITICALLY WOUNDED

00:18:16.907 --> 00:18:18.010

IT IS A RISKY GAMBLE,

00:18:20.749 --> 00:18:22.619
WHICH IS WHY WE BROUGHT
ALL THE REAGENTS

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.490
AND HEALING POTIONS
FROM THE CAPITAL.

00:18:24.557 --> 00:18:26.694
IF WE USE OUR SACRED ARTS
ONLY FOR HEALING

00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:28.164
AND THE POTIONS FOR SUPPORT,

00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:30.601
THE REAGENTS SHOULD LAST
FOR AT LEAST THREE DAYS.

WHILE SOLUS AND TERRARIA’S
BLESSINGS ARE SPARSE THERE,

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.757
DURING THE BATTLE,
WITH EACH WARRIOR WHO FALLS,

00:18:41.824 --> 00:18:44.796
MORE SACRED POWER
WILL BE RELEASED AND ACCUMULATE.

00:18:44.863 --> 00:18:48.470
I DO NOT SEE HOW WE CAN ABSORB
ALL THOSE EXTRA RESOURCES

00:18:48.537 --> 00:18:51.044
IF THERE ARE NOT
ENOUGH OF US TO DO SO.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.051

WELL, ACTUALLY, ONE OF US CAN.

TO THE LAST DROP IF I HAVE TO.

00:19:38.037 --> 00:19:40.508

00:19:40.575 --> 00:19:42.679
AND CALL YOU
WITH THE LAST OF MY BREATH,

00:19:42.746 --> 00:19:45.451
