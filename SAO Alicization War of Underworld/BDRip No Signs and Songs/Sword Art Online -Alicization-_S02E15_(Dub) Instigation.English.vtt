but the Red Knights
from my world are closing in.

I must go join them.

to the World’s End Altar.

Alice: Why should I?

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:26.618
Emperor Vecta is dead,
is he not?

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:28.823
Sinon: Sort of,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.294
but it’s not that simple.

00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:34.901

You can destroy the shell,

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:45.323
but the person, the one inside

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:47.259
can come back here if they want.

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:51.736

Uncle sacrificed himself to kill

00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:54.173
is not really dead?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.576
He has simply vanished

00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:58.315
and will awaken
in your world alive,

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.152

00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:17.554
where only one risks their life?

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.390
That is no duel!

00:02:19.457 --> 00:02:22.531

You don’t think
his intentions and suffering

00:02:29.778 --> 00:02:32.116

If he died here,
he wouldn’t really die.

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:44.240
But still, like, everything
he felt here was real.

00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:46.311
His wounds,
the pain he suffered,

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:49.718

they’re all real.

All he wanted was to save you,
and that’s real,

00:03:16.437 --> 00:03:19.712
