# Dialogue
All dialogue subtitles are capitalized
Dialogue subtitles are formatted as such

	Kirito: IT WAS FULL OF EMOTIONS THAT <br />SCARE AND CONFUSE ME!

	(Example from Abridged S01E06)

unless the line of dialogue is from the same person as the previous line of dialogue, in which case the speaker's name is ommited

# Hearing impaired
All hearing imparied subtitles are not lowercase with the exception of character names
Hearing impaired subtitles are formatted as such

	( beeping, whirring )

or they may also be formatted like this

	Kirito: ( gasps )

The important thing is they are with parenthises, lowercase, and with spaces.

# Unnamed characters
Unnamed characters are to be named as such

	Man 1: WELL I TOLD <br />HIM, SO IT'S HIS DEAL.
	Man 2: WHY DON'T WE FORM A PARTY?
	Woman 1: WELL, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.
	Man 2: OH, COME ON. IT'LL BE GREAT.

	(Example from S01E01)

for off-handed dialogue, or as such

	Announcer: HI, THERE! TIME FOR <br />THIS WEEK'S MMO STREAM.

	(Example from S01E01)

for unnamed characters with more dialogue.


# IRL vs in-game names
Characters are to be referred to by their IRL name when the scene takes place in the real world, and in-game names when the scene takes place in a game. This should not be hard. Why did you do it like this. Why is "Kirito" sitting in his living room with "Leafa". I understand characters like Klein (Tsuboi) and Lisbeth (Rika) but holy fuck get your shit together with Kazuto and Sugou jesus christ.
