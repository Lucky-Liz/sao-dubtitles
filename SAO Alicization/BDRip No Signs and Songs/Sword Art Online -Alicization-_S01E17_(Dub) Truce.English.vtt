00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.663
IN THE SAME BREATH
AS THOSE SO‐CALLED NOBLES.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.665
I'VE SEEN IT. I‐‐

00:19:34.732 --> 00:19:37.000
I'VE BEEN...

00:19:37.067 --> 00:19:38.536
Kirito: A‐ALICE?

00:19:38.602 --> 00:19:42.372
Alice: NO.
I HAVE ONLY HEARD OF IT.

00:19:42.439 --> 00:19:45.876
ONE OF THE PRIESTS
MUST HAVE TOLD ME OF IT.

00:19:45.943 --> 00:19:47.344
WE INTEGRITY KNIGHTS,

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.480
WE ARE PROHIBITED FROM MINGLING
WITH THE TOWNSFOLK,

00:19:50.548 --> 00:19:52.816
EXCEPT IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:55.218
Kirito: WHAT?

00:19:55.285 --> 00:19:57.688
Alice: MINION BLOOD
CARRIES DISEASE.

00:19:57.755 --> 00:20:00.257
YOU SHOULD WIPE IT OFF.

00:20:00.323 --> 00:20:01.659
Kirito: HUH? OH.

00:20:01.725 --> 00:20:03.861
( Alice gasps )
NO, NOT LIKE THAT!

00:20:03.927 --> 00:20:05.596
( Kirito gasps )

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:09.066
Alice: HONESTLY! COULD A MAN
BE ANY MORE THOUGHTLESS?

00:20:09.132 --> 00:20:12.870
ARE YOU SO UNCOUTH, YOU DO
NOT EVEN HAVE A HANDKERCHIEF?

00:20:12.936 --> 00:20:14.572
Kirito: N‐NO, I DON'T.

00:20:14.638 --> 00:20:17.107
Alice: AS I THOUGHT. USE MINE.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.341
Kirito: UH...

00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:21.278
THANKS. I APPRECIATE IT.

00:20:21.344 --> 00:20:22.479
Alice: UH...

00:20:22.546 --> 00:20:23.413
( scoffs )

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.617
I WOULD LIKE IT
WASHED AND RETURNED

00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:28.451
BEFORE I SLAY YOU.

00:20:30.153 --> 00:20:31.454
( Kirito chuckles )

00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:33.456
♪♪

00:20:36.259 --> 00:20:37.728
Eugeo: NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,

00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:40.564
EVER SINCE I MET KIRITO
TWO YEARS AGO,

00:20:40.631 --> 00:20:43.233
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN WITH ME.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.403
I'VE FORGOTTEN
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ALONE.

00:20:48.471 --> 00:20:50.674
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:52.810
KNOWING HIM, I'M SURE HE IS.

00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:54.812
HE'S PROBABLY
CLIMBING THE TOWER,

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.179
LOOKING FOR A WAY IN

00:20:56.246 --> 00:20:58.448
ALONG WITH ALICE.

00:21:06.256 --> 00:21:08.225
THE 90th FLOOR.

00:21:11.428 --> 00:21:13.831
AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT
IS IN THERE.

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.000
HERE GOES.

00:21:21.271 --> 00:21:23.406
( door grinding )

00:21:35.853 --> 00:21:38.355
IT'S A GIANT BATH.

00:21:38.421 --> 00:21:40.558
‐ ( water splashes )
‐ ( gasps )

00:21:44.227 --> 00:21:45.328
Knight: EASY, KID.

00:21:45.395 --> 00:21:48.265
I NEED TO STRETCH
BEFORE WE START.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.704
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM PATROLLING THE BORDERLANDS.

00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:58.408
RIDING THAT DRAGON NONSTOP
SURE DOES A NUMBER ON THE BODY.

00:22:00.878 --> 00:22:01.979
( Eugeo gasps )

00:22:03.413 --> 00:22:04.682
( Knight sighs )

00:22:04.748 --> 00:22:05.916
( chuckles )
