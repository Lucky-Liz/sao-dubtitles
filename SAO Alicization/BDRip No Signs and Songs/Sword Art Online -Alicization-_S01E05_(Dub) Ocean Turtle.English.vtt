HEY, LIZ.

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:23.305
Rika: WE'RE OUT IN FRONT
OF RATH'S OFFICE NOW.

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:25.040
THEIR SECURITY'S SUPER TIGHT,

00:10:25.107 --> 00:10:26.675
AND THEY WOULDN'T
TELL US A THING.

00:10:26.741 --> 00:10:29.211
OH, AND THERE'S
CAMERAS ALL AROUND,

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:31.746
SO WE ASKED YUI
TO CHECK OUT THE FOOTAGE.

00:10:31.813 --> 00:10:35.050
AS FAR AS SHE COULD TELL,
THEY DIDN'T BRING KIRITO HERE.

00:10:35.117 --> 00:10:38.220
Asuna: OKAY.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:40.222
HEY, YUI.

00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:41.790
Yui: HERE, MOMMY.

00:10:41.856 --> 00:10:45.127
I JUST CHECKED ALL THE SECURITY
CAMERAS IN THE HARBOR.

00:10:46.661 --> 00:10:49.431
THIS PROPERTY HAS
A HELIPAD OVER THERE.

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:53.502
YESTERDAY, AT 21:20,
A HELICOPTER TOOK OFF FROM IT.

00:10:53.568 --> 00:10:55.337
Asuna: DO YOU KNOW
IF HE WAS ON IT?

00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:59.174
Yui: WELL, I CAN'T CONFIRM,
BUT I BELIEVE HE WAS.

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:00.742
( Suguha gasps ) OH, MY GOD.

00:11:00.809 --> 00:11:03.512
THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN HIM
ANYWHERE THEN. NOW WHAT?

00:11:03.578 --> 00:11:05.380
Asuna:
WAIT. LET'S NOT PANIC.

00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:06.515
YUI.

00:11:06.581 --> 00:11:08.083
JUST CONFIRMING,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.685
THIS IS THE LAST PLACE
HIS SIGNAL SHOWED UP?

00:11:10.752 --> 00:11:11.853
Yui: YES, IT IS.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.388
Asuna: HE NEEDS TREATMENT,

00:11:13.455 --> 00:11:16.191
SO THEY'LL HAVE TO TAKE HIM
TO SOME KIND OF FACILITY.

00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:17.692
BUT IF THEY LANDED,

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:20.629
KIRITO'S SIGNAL SHOULD HAVE
POPPED UP AGAIN BY NOW,

00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:23.865
UNLESS WHEREVER HE IS
IS OUT OF RANGE.

00:11:23.932 --> 00:11:25.900
Yui: YES, THAT MUST BE THE CASE.

00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:28.270
IT'S POSSIBLE THEY TOOK HIM
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

00:11:28.337 --> 00:11:29.904
Tsuboi: SAY WHAT?!

00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:31.806
Yui: IT'S ONE POSSIBILITY.

00:11:31.873 --> 00:11:33.742
IT'S ALSO THE MOST LIKELY.

00:11:33.808 --> 00:11:35.344
Tsuboi: WHAT DO WE DO?

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.579
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD BY NOW.

00:11:37.646 --> 00:11:41.383
Suguha: HE'S RIGHT. HOW THE HECK
ARE WE GONNA FIND HIM?

00:11:42.584 --> 00:11:44.086
Asuna: KIRITO.

00:11:44.153 --> 00:11:47.422
Yui: CHEER UP, MOMMY. HAVE HOPE.

00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:48.657
Asuna: I'M TRYING.

00:11:48.723 --> 00:11:50.559
Yui: WHEN YOU
WERE TRAPPED IN ALFHEIM,

00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:52.627
DADDY SEARCHED
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:55.930
HE NEVER GAVE UP,
AND EVENTUALLY, HE FOUND YOU!

00:11:55.997 --> 00:11:57.032
Asuna: I KNOW.

00:11:57.099 --> 00:11:58.267
Yui: THEN CHEER UP!

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:00.435
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO SEARCH FOR HIM!

00:12:00.502 --> 00:12:02.137
I KNOW YOU'LL FIND A CLUE

00:12:02.204 --> 00:12:03.905
THAT WILL LEAD YOU
STRAIGHT TO DADDY.

00:12:03.972 --> 00:12:07.476
AND IF ANYONE STANDS
IN YOUR WAY, THEY'LL BE SORRY.

00:12:07.542 --> 00:12:11.480
BECAUSE NOTHING, NO ONE,
CAN SEVER THE BOND BETWEEN YOU.

00:12:23.825 --> 00:12:26.361
Asuna: IT DIDN'T MATTER
WHAT DANGERS HE FACED.

00:12:26.428 --> 00:12:29.298
KIRITO NEVER BACKED DOWN.

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:31.533
I'LL FIND HIM,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.103
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO.

00:12:34.169 --> 00:12:36.305
THANKS FOR THE PEP TALK, YUI.

00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:38.673
YOU'RE RIGHT. I WON'T GIVE UP.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.810
( Yui giggles )
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

00:12:41.876 --> 00:12:43.878
Asuna: LET'S THINK
FOR A SEC HERE.

00:12:43.945 --> 00:12:45.647
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT RATH?

00:12:45.714 --> 00:12:49.318
ASSUMING THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO HAVE KIRITO NOW.

00:12:49.384 --> 00:12:53.055
SUGUHA, DID KIRITO EVER
TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THEM,

00:12:53.122 --> 00:12:54.623
ANYTHING AT ALL?

00:12:54.689 --> 00:12:56.791
Suguha: I HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM THAT MUCH LATELY

00:12:56.858 --> 00:12:57.859
'CAUSE OF HIS WORK.

00:12:57.926 --> 00:13:01.130
WE TALKED A BIT
NOW AND THEN, BUT NOT MUCH.

00:13:01.196 --> 00:13:03.265
YOU KNOW WHAT?
COME TO THINK OF IT,

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:04.833
HE DID SAY SOMETHING ONCE,

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:07.369
SOMETHING ABOUT
HOW THAT MACHINE HE WAS TESTING

00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:09.338
WAS BASED ON THE MEDICUBOID.

00:13:09.404 --> 00:13:12.941
Asuna: THEY SHARE THE SAME TECH?
I HAD NO IDEA.

00:13:13.008 --> 00:13:15.577
THE MEDICUBOID.

00:13:15.644 --> 00:13:18.413
I JUST REMEMBERED
SOMETHING HE TOLD ME.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.315
YOU KNOW
WHO DESIGNED THE MEDICUBOID?

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:23.218
THE COMMANDER, AKIHIKO KAYABA.

00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:25.287
HE LAID THE GROUNDWORK,

00:13:25.354 --> 00:13:27.322
BUT HIS PARTNER DEVELOPED IT
FOR HOSPITALS.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:29.658
Kazuto: YEAH, IN FACT,
SHE WAS TAKING CARE

00:13:29.724 --> 00:13:32.294
OF HEATHCLIFF'S BODY
WHILE HE WAS DIVING.

00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:34.196
SHE WAS HIS HEAD RESEARCHER.

00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:37.399
SHE HELPED HIM DEVELOP
FULL‐DIVE TECHNOLOGY.

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:39.368
Asuna: WHAT WAS HER NAME?

00:13:39.434 --> 00:13:42.937
RINKO KOJIRO, I THINK.

00:13:43.005 --> 00:13:45.707
Yui: I'LL RUN A SEARCH.

00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:49.078
I FOUND SOMEONE WHO'S MOST
LIKELY THE PERSON YOU MENTIONED.

00:13:49.144 --> 00:13:51.280
CURRENTLY, SHE'S A RESEARCHER

00:13:51.346 --> 00:13:53.815
AT THE CALIFORNIA
TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE.

00:13:53.882 --> 00:13:55.084
THIS IS HER.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.588
THE UNIVERSITY'S DATABASE
DETAILS HER CAREER SO FAR.

00:13:59.654 --> 00:14:01.890
SHE'S A FORMER MEMBER
OF THE SHIGEMURA LAB

OF TECHNOLOGY'S

DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL
AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.

Suguha: WAIT. ISN'T SHIGEMURA
THE GUY WHO MADE THE AUGMA?

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:14.503
Asuna: YEAH, AND KAYABA
WAS ONE OF HIS STUDENTS.

00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:21.476
SHE MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THE S.T.L. AND RATH.

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:36.025
( Rinko sighs )

00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:46.735
WAIT. A FLOATING CASTLE?

00:14:46.801 --> 00:14:51.440
Kayaba: YEAH. A CASTLE
IN THE SKY WITH NUMEROUS FLOORS,

00:14:51.506 --> 00:14:53.675
100 FLOORS, MAYBE,

00:14:53.742 --> 00:14:57.646
AND EACH ONE HAS A TOWN,
A FOREST, AND A PLAIN.

00:14:57.712 --> 00:15:01.916
TO GET TO THE NEXT FLOOR,
YOU CLIMB A LONG STAIRCASE,

00:15:01.983 --> 00:15:05.254
AND WHEN YOU REACH THE TOP,
YOU'LL FIND A PALACE.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.157
Rinko: SO WHAT'S IN THE PALACE?

00:15:08.223 --> 00:15:09.958
Kayaba: I DON'T KNOW.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.461
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,

00:15:12.527 --> 00:15:16.465
I USED TO GO TO THAT CASTLE
EVERY NIGHT IN MY DREAMS.

00:15:16.531 --> 00:15:19.501
EVERY NIGHT,
I'D CLIMB UP EACH STAIRCASE

00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:24.173
AND GET CLOSER TO THE TOP,
BIT BY BIT.

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:25.607
BUT THEN, AT SOME POINT,

00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:29.578
( sighs )
I WASN'T ABLE TO GO THERE AGAIN.

00:15:32.514 --> 00:15:34.583
( sighs )

00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:39.621
IT WAS JUST A SILLY DREAM.

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:42.524
I PRETTY MUCH FORGOT
ALL ABOUT IT.

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:52.134

OH, SEE IT.
YEAH, I GUESS IT LOOKS LIKE ONE.

00:16:36.847 --> 00:16:39.816
LOOKS MORE LIKE A PIG
FROM HERE, THOUGH.

DOESN'T MEAN

IN A FEW DAYS, I'LL SHOW‐‐

00:19:57.714 --> 00:19:59.183
Asuna: MR. KIKUOKA...

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.852
‐ YOU'LL TAKE US TO HIM NOW.
‐ ( Kikuoka gasps )

00:20:05.122 --> 00:20:08.659
A‐ASUNA, I‐‐
WH‐WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:20:08.725 --> 00:20:11.662
Rinko: SHE SENT ME
AN INTERESTING EMAIL.

00:20:15.499 --> 00:20:17.168
Asuna: AN ORGANIZATION
CALLED RATH

00:20:17.234 --> 00:20:20.071
IS DEVELOPING A MACHINE
CALLED THE SOUL TRANSLATOR.

00:20:20.137 --> 00:20:21.972
IT'S BASED ON THE MEDICUBOID,

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:25.842
THE MEDICAL FULL‐DIVE RIG
YOU DESIGNED THE TECHNOLOGY FOR.

00:20:27.011 --> 00:20:30.047
KAZUTO KIRIGAYA
WAS TESTING THIS NEW MACHINE,

00:20:30.114 --> 00:20:34.318
BUT HE DISAPPEARED, AND I
NEED YOUR HELP TO FIND HIM.

00:20:34.385 --> 00:20:36.320
Rinko: KAZUTO KIRIGAYA?

00:20:36.387 --> 00:20:39.256
Kazuto: I WAS
IN THE OLD S.A.O. SERVER,

00:20:39.323 --> 00:20:42.326
AND I MET KAYABA'S
DIGITAL GHOST THERE.

00:20:42.393 --> 00:20:43.627
( Rinko gasps )

00:20:43.694 --> 00:20:45.029
Kazuto: WE SPOKE.

00:20:45.096 --> 00:20:47.564
HE GAVE ME A PROGRAM
CALLED THE SEED.

00:20:47.631 --> 00:20:52.136
DO YOU KNOW IT? IF YOU DO,
I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS.

00:20:52.203 --> 00:20:53.970
( Rinko sighs )

00:20:55.706 --> 00:20:57.874
IF YOU HATE HIM
FOR WHAT HE DID,

00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:00.477
THEN JUST DELETE IT,
AND FORGET ALL ABOUT IT.

00:21:00.544 --> 00:21:03.714
IT'S OKAY, REALLY. END IT.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.482
BUT IF THERE'S
STILL A PART OF YOU

00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:07.251
THAT SEES VR'S POTENTIAL...

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.623
Asuna: AFTER KIRITO DISAPPEARED,
I WENT THROUGH HIS CONTACTS,

00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:14.825
AND THAT'S WHERE
I FOUND YOUR EMAIL.

00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:17.561
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RATH,
ANYTHING AT ALL,

00:21:17.628 --> 00:21:19.096
IT COULD HELP ME FIND HIM.

00:21:19.163 --> 00:21:22.399
YOU'RE MY LAST HOPE, DR. KOJIRO.

00:21:22.466 --> 00:21:25.069
HELP ME, PLEASE.

00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:27.571
Rinko: SORRY.
DID WE SURPRISE YOU?

00:21:27.638 --> 00:21:29.173
ARE YOU HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS NOW

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.243
ABOUT INVITING ME TO BE
ON YOUR PROJECT, MR. KIKUOKA?

00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:33.744
Kikuoka: APPARENTLY,
OUR SECURITY

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.379
WASN'T THOROUGH ENOUGH.

00:21:35.446 --> 00:21:38.649
I KNOW WE HAVE YOUR ASSISTANT'S
PHOTO FROM THE UNIVERSITY.

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:40.717
THEY SHOULD HAVE RUN
A PROPER CHECK.

00:21:40.784 --> 00:21:42.286
Asuna: THEY DID. ON OUR WAY IN,

00:21:42.353 --> 00:21:44.621
THEY SCANNED MY FACE
QUITE A FEW TIMES, IN FACT.

00:21:44.688 --> 00:21:48.192
BUT I HAD HER ASSISTANT'S PHOTO
IN THE SCHOOL'S DATABASE

00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:50.327
SWITCHED WITH MINE A WHILE AGO.

00:21:50.394 --> 00:21:51.062
( Kikuoka gasps )

00:21:51.128 --> 00:21:52.429
Asuna: I HAPPEN TO KNOW SOMEONE

00:21:52.496 --> 00:21:55.132
WHO'S GREAT
AT BUSTING THROUGH FIREWALLS.

00:21:55.199 --> 00:21:56.533
Rinko: RIGHT NOW,
THE REAL MAYUMI

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.770
IS PROBABLY ON A BEACH
SOMEWHERE WORKING ON HER TAN.

00:22:03.707 --> 00:22:06.110
Asuna: TAKE ME TO KIRITO.
