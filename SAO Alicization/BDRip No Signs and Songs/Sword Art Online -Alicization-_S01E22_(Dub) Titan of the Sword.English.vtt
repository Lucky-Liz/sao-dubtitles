00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.116
HE COULD CONJURE SUCH SPELLS.

00:02:43.182 --> 00:02:44.483
I UNDERESTIMATED HIM.

00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:49.222
THAT FIRE GIANT IS A BEING
MADE ENTIRELY OF MAGIC.

00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:51.490
MY FLOWERS CANNOT DESTROY
SUCH A THING,

00:02:51.558 --> 00:02:53.860
AND I DOUBT THEY COULD
HOLD IT OFF FOR VERY LONG.

00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:57.330
Kirito: HOW LONG? I MEAN,
WE DON'T NEED THAT MUCH TIME,

00:02:57.396 --> 00:02:59.432
JUST ENOUGH
TO GET UP CLOSE TO CHUDELKIN.

00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:03.803
Alice: FOR TEN SECONDS, NO MORE,
PERHAPS LESS THAN THAT.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.775
STILL, YOU'RE RIGHT. I'LL DRAW
ITS ATTENTION WHILE YOU ATTACK,

00:03:11.144 --> 00:03:13.813

THAT WAS RATHER ANTICLIMACTIC.

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.552
I DID GAIN SOME USEFUL
INFORMATION FROM IT, THOUGH,

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:35.354
SO IT'S NOT A TOTAL LOSS.

00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:37.290

SO, IRREGULAR BOY,

00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:47.501
I THINK I'VE FIGURED OUT
THE MYSTERY OF YOU.

00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:50.704
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
I COULDN'T SEE YOUR PROPERTIES

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.141
BECAUSE YOU WERE UNREGISTERED,
AN ILLEGITIMATE BIRTH,

00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:56.643
BUT I WAS WRONG.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.278
YOU'RE HUMAN,
NOT FROM THIS WORLD.

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:01.114
YOU'RE FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.349

YOU DON'T FEEL
THREATENED BY ME, DO YOU?

00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:14.861
I GOT THE SAME AUTHORITY LEVEL
AS EVERYONE ELSE.

00:06:14.928 --> 00:06:18.297
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS HIGH
AS YOURS, THAT'S FOR SURE,

00:06:19.498 --> 00:06:21.901

WITH RIDICULOUS STORIES.

WELL, BOY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN MY WORLD?

00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:34.881
I DOUBT YOU JUST STUMBLED IN
OUT OF CURIOSITY.

00:06:34.948 --> 00:06:36.550
Kirito: YOU'RE RIGHT. I DIDN'T.

00:06:36.616 --> 00:06:38.618
YOUR WORLD'S
GONNA END REAL SOON,

00:06:38.685 --> 00:06:40.854
AND IT'S GONNA BE
ALL YOUR FAULT.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.522
( Administrator laughs )
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.424
ARE YOU SAYING I'LL DESTROY IT?

00:06:45.491 --> 00:06:46.526
Kirito: PRETTY MUCH.

00:06:46.593 --> 00:06:48.662
THE DARK TERRITORY WILL INVADE.

00:06:48.728 --> 00:06:50.930
THAT'S WHY YOU MADE
THE INTEGRITY KNIGHTS,

00:06:50.997 --> 00:06:54.501
TO STOP IT, BUT YOUR FAITH
IN THEM'S YOUR MISTAKE.

00:06:54.568 --> 00:06:56.069
THEY WON'T BE ENOUGH.

00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:57.170

00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:59.038

EXACTLY LIKE SOMETHING

00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:00.840
THAT LITTLE BRAT WOULD SAY.

00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:02.075
HOW PITIFUL,

00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:05.512
BOTH HER, FOR BEING SO DESPERATE
TO HAVE ME EXPELLED,

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:07.847
AND YOU, FOR BEING SO GULLIBLE.

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.752
Alice: MADAM PONTIFEX,
IF I MAY,

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.321
THE ARMY OF THE DARK
HAS GROWN RAPIDLY.

00:07:13.388 --> 00:07:14.690
IF THEY INVADE NOW,

00:07:14.756 --> 00:07:17.125
THE CURRENT NUMBER OF KNIGHTS
CANNOT WITHSTAND IT.

00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:22.363
THE COMMANDER BELIEVED SO,
AS DID VICE COMMANDER FANATIO

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.866
AND I, I AS WELL.

00:07:24.933 --> 00:07:28.436
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN NOW THAT
THE ORDER OF KNIGHTS IS NO MORE?

00:07:28.504 --> 00:07:31.607
DO YOU THINK YOU ALONE
CAN PROTECT THE EMPIRE?

00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:34.342
BUT WHAT ANGERS ME MORE
THAN YOUR HUBRIS,

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:37.112
YOU HAVE STOLEN
US KNIGHTS FROM OUR PARENTS,

00:07:37.178 --> 00:07:40.616
FROM WIVES AND HUSBANDS,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

00:07:40.682 --> 00:07:43.685
YOU SEALED AWAY
OUR MEMORIES OF THEM

00:07:43.752 --> 00:07:45.486
AND REPLACED THEM WITH LIES

00:07:45.554 --> 00:07:48.156
OF BEING SUMMONED
FROM A NONEXISTENT HEAVEN!

00:07:49.224 --> 00:07:52.060
PONTIFEX, COULD YOU NOT TRUST US

00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:55.230
TO BE LOYAL TO YOU
AND RESPECT YOUR AUTHORITY?

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:57.132
WERE WE SUCH A THREAT TO YOU,

00:07:57.198 --> 00:08:00.602
YOU HAD TO SUBMIT US
TO SUCH A MONSTROUS RITUAL

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:03.038
AND FORCE OUR SOULS
INTO OBEDIENCE?!

00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:04.205
( Eugeo grunts )

00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:09.611
Administrator:
I DO TRUST YOU, THOUGH.

00:08:09.678 --> 00:08:11.046
IN FACT, I LOVE YOU.

00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:13.982
THE PIETY MODULE
INSTALLED IN YOU KNIGHTS

00:08:14.049 --> 00:08:18.186
IS PROOF OF MY LOVE,
A GIFT FROM ME TO YOU ALL.

00:08:18.253 --> 00:08:19.521
WHY, THIS LITTLE THING

00:08:19.588 --> 00:08:22.724
FREES YOU FROM THE WORRY
AND PAIN OF NORMAL FOLK.

00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:26.728
YOU ARE MY BEAUTIFUL DOLLS,
BEAUTIFUL FOR ALL ETERNITY.

00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:28.997
Alice: OUT OF ALL
THE KNIGHTS, UNC‐‐

00:08:29.064 --> 00:08:33.802
COMMANDER BERCOULI HAS
SHOWN YOU THE DEEPEST LOYALTY,

00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:35.971
BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW THE MAN,

00:08:36.037 --> 00:08:41.543
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS SERVED YOU
FAITHFULLY FOR 300 LONG YEARS.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.213
DO YOU THINK HE DID NOT SUFFER
ONCE IN ALL THAT TIME?

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.449
DID YOU NOT KNOW OF THE PAIN
HE CARRIED IN HIS HEART?

00:08:48.517 --> 00:08:51.653
ARE YOU THAT OBLIVIOUS?!

00:08:52.988 --> 00:08:55.156
Administrator:
YOU THINK SO LITTLE OF ME.

00:08:55.223 --> 00:08:56.291
OF COURSE I KNEW.

00:08:56.357 --> 00:08:58.126
THESE THINGS YOU SPEAK OF

00:08:58.193 --> 00:09:01.162
DIDN'T START BOTHERING BERCOULI
RECENTLY, THOUGH.

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:02.864
HE BROUGHT THEM UP AGES AGO.

00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:06.201
A CENTURY, I THINK?
YES, ABOUT THAT, GIVE OR TAKE.

00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:09.104
I COULDN'T WATCH HIM BROOD
OVER SUCH TRIVIALITIES,

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.941
SO I FIXED HIM,
RESET HIM, TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

00:09:13.008 --> 00:09:14.242
( laughs )

00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:16.645
AND HE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE.

00:09:16.712 --> 00:09:20.148
I RESET EVERY KNIGHT
MORE THAN A CENTURY OLD.

00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:21.817
ALL OF THEIR PAINFUL MEMORIES

00:09:21.883 --> 00:09:24.586
AND TROUBLING THOUGHTS
WERE WIPED AWAY.

00:09:24.653 --> 00:09:26.688
DON'T YOU WORRY, ALICE.

00:09:26.755 --> 00:09:28.724
I'LL OVERLOOK
YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.993
AND ERASE ALL THE THOUGHTS
THAT MAKE YOU SO MISERABLE, TOO.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.063
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU'LL GO
BACK TO BEING MY PUPPET

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.232
AND HAVE NO NEED TO THINK.

00:09:37.298 --> 00:09:38.299

00:09:40.435 --> 00:09:41.670
Alice: YOU ARE CORRECT.

00:09:41.737 --> 00:09:44.706
RIGHT NOW, I FEEL
ENOUGH SADNESS AND PAIN

00:09:44.773 --> 00:09:46.742
TO TEAR MY HEART TO PIECES.

00:09:46.808 --> 00:09:50.612
HOWEVER, I CHOOSE TO EMBRACE IT.

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:54.550
I DO NOT WISH TO ERASE
WHAT I HAVE NEVER FELT BEFORE.

00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:57.318
THIS PAIN SERVES A PURPOSE.

00:09:57.385 --> 00:09:59.120
IT REMINDS ME WHAT I AM,

00:09:59.187 --> 00:10:03.158
A HUMAN BEING
AND NOT A PUPPET KNIGHT.

00:10:03.224 --> 00:10:07.829
MADAM PONTIFEX, I DO
NOT WANT YOUR SO‐CALLED LOVE,

00:10:07.896 --> 00:10:10.431
AND I DO NOT NEED YOU
TO FIX ME!

00:10:10.498 --> 00:10:12.634
Administrator:
I'M SAD TO HEAR THAT.

00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:15.470
UNFORTUNATELY,
WHAT YOU WANT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:10:15.537 --> 00:10:17.205
AS SOON AS I RESYNTHESIZE YOU‐‐

00:10:17.272 --> 00:10:20.709
AND I WILL‐‐THE PESKY FEELINGS
THAT TROUBLE YOU NOW

00:10:20.776 --> 00:10:22.210
WILL BE ERASED COMPLETELY.

00:10:22.277 --> 00:10:25.380
Kirito: KINDA LIKE WHAT YOU DID
TO YOURSELF WAY BACK WHEN,

00:10:25.446 --> 00:10:27.716
HUH, QUINELLA?

00:10:28.717 --> 00:10:30.151
Administrator:
WATCH IT, LITTLE BOY.

00:10:30.218 --> 00:10:33.154
DREDGING UP THE PAST
IS CONSIDERED QUITE RUDE.

00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:36.992
Kirito: WHY? YOU SCARED
THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT?

00:10:37.058 --> 00:10:41.162
NO ONE'S GOT THE POWER
TO ERASE THE PAST, NOT EVEN YOU.

00:10:41.229 --> 00:10:43.765
YOU WERE BORN A HUMAN
AND RAISED A HUMAN.

00:10:43.832 --> 00:10:45.734
AND NO MATTER
HOW MUCH POWER YOU GOT,

00:10:45.801 --> 00:10:48.670
THAT'S ONE THING
YOU CAN'T CHANGE, CAN YOU?

00:10:48.737 --> 00:10:50.405
Administrator:
I'M NOT QUITE SURE

00:10:50.471 --> 00:10:51.807
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT,

00:10:51.873 --> 00:10:53.809
LITTLE BOY FROM THE OUTER WORLD.

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:55.911
Kirito: ALL YOU WANT
IS TO BE A GOD,

00:10:55.977 --> 00:10:58.647
BUT YOU CAN NEVER BE A GOD,
'CAUSE YOU'RE HUMAN.

00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:02.383
BEING HUMAN
MEANS YOU MAKE MISTAKES,
