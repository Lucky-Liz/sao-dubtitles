Kirito: YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:12.011
WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING
BEHIND YOUR STRIKES.

00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:15.014
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA TIP THINGS
IN YOUR FAVOR.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.549
‐ Eugeo: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
‐ Kirito: IT'S LIKE,

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.452
FOR VOLO, IT'S THE PRIDE
AND RESPONSIBILITY

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.221
THAT COMES
WITH BEING FROM A FAMILY

00:00:22.287 --> 00:00:23.888
THAT TEACHES SWORDSMANSHIP.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:27.426
FOR GOLGOROSSO,
IT'S THE CONFIDENCE HE'S GOT

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:30.129
FROM HAVING MUSCLES OF STEEL,

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:31.363
AND FOR LIENA,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.033
IT'S THE PRIDE SHE TAKES
IN HER POLISHED SKILLS.

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:35.767
THAT'S THE REASON
WHY THEIR ATTACKS

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:37.302
ARE AS POWERFUL AS THEY ARE.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:41.273
Eugeo: THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD PUT BEHIND MY SWORD?

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.574
Kirito: THAT'S SOMETHIN'

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.010
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT YOURSELF.

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:47.779
Eugeo: I'M NOT A NOBLE
OR A SWORDSMAN.

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:53.085
ALL I HAVE ARE MY YEARS SPENT
IN THE FOREST WIELDING AN AX,

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:56.988
THAT AND THE AINCRAD STYLE
KIRITO TAUGHT ME.

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:02.394

PREFERS HACKING AWAY AT LOGS,

00:02:53.653 --> 00:02:55.555
RATHER THAN WORKING
ON HIS FORM.

00:02:55.622 --> 00:02:57.757
Humbert: I RECALL
ONCE HEARING SIR EUGEO

00:02:57.824 --> 00:03:00.560
USED TO BE A WOODCUTTER
IN SOME BACKWOODS HOVEL.

00:03:00.627 --> 00:03:02.229
PERHAPS THE EXTENT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE

00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:04.964
IS LIMITED TO METHODS
OF ATTACKING LUMBER.

00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:06.633
Raios: HOW TRULY UNFORTUNATE.

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.835
IF THAT IS INDEED THE CASE,

00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:11.904
THEN AS SOMEONE WHO HAPPENS
TO TRAIN IN THE SAME DORM,

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:14.174
PERHAPS I SHOULD
GRACIOUSLY LEND A HAND

00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:16.743
AND INSTRUCT HIM
ON PROPER TECHNIQUE.

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.578
Humbert: MY,
WHAT A CONSIDERATE THING

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:20.180
OF YOU TO OFFER, LORD RAIOS.

00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:22.615
YOU TRULY ARE
AN EXEMPLARY NOBLE.

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:25.285
WHAT SAY YOU TO THAT, SIR EUGEO?

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:27.487
WILL YOU ACCEPT
LORD RAIOS'S GENEROSITY

00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:28.721
AND HAVE HIM TRAIN YOU?

00:03:28.788 --> 00:03:32.292

I APPRECIATE THE OFF‐‐( gasps )

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.798
Kirito: SOME UPPERCLASSMEN
USE THEIR STATUS

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:40.433
AS A SOURCE OF POWER.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.169
Eugeo: IS THAT
WHY FIRST SEAT RAIOS

00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:44.337
AND SECOND SEAT HUMBERT
ARE SO STRONG?

00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:47.007
Kirito: IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT
WITH THOSE GUYS.

00:03:47.074 --> 00:03:49.509
THEIR EGOS ARE
ON A WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL.

00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:50.877
Eugeo: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

00:03:50.943 --> 00:03:52.612
Kirito: 'CAUSE THEY'RE
A COUPLE OF JERKS.

DON'T THINK MUCH OF US.

00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:00.953

OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL,

IS NO SLOUCH
WHEN IT COMES TO SWORDPLAY.

00:04:35.022 --> 00:04:36.523
HE MAY END UP STRIKING YOU.

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:39.859
Eugeo: I WOULD PREFER IF HE
STOPPED JUST SHORT OF THAT,

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:43.130
BUT IF HE HITS ME,
THEN I MUST ACCEPT IT.

00:04:43.196 --> 00:04:45.898
THIS LESSON IS FOR MY BENEFIT,
AFTER ALL.

IS CAPABLE OF?

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:09.349
I CAN'T WALK AWAY
FROM THIS ROGUE WITH A DRAW!

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:11.251
I MUST FINISH THIS!

DISCIPLE EUGEO,

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:28.901
YOUR OUTLANDISH MOVES
WERE QUITE ENTERTAINING.

00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:31.771
AFTER GRADUATING,
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

00:06:31.838 --> 00:06:34.074

WITH THE IMPERIAL CIRCUS.

YOU NAMELESS BUFFOON.

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:00.900
( Eugeo sighs )

00:07:02.802 --> 00:07:04.304
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.

00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:07.607
THEY SHOULD HAVE TRIED
GETTING BACK AT ME BY NOW.

00:07:07.674 --> 00:07:10.043
I WONDER WHY THEY HAVEN'T.

00:07:13.513 --> 00:07:15.448
Kirito: THEY'D BE
BREAKIN' THE RULES,

00:07:15.515 --> 00:07:17.450
THE SCHOOL'S
AND THE TABOO INDEX'S.

00:07:17.517 --> 00:07:20.553
THOSE DON'T MAKE IT EASY
TO HARASS PEOPLE.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.391
ON THE OTHER HAND, ANYTHING THAT
DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE RULES

00:07:24.457 --> 00:07:25.425
IS UP FOR DEBATE.

00:07:25.492 --> 00:07:27.860
THEY COULD BE LOOKIN'
FOR A LOOPHOLE.

00:07:27.927 --> 00:07:30.597
Eugeo: YOU THINK
THEY'D GO THAT FAR

00:07:30.663 --> 00:07:31.798
JUST TO SPITE ME?

00:07:31.864 --> 00:07:33.266
Kirito: I DON'T KNOW.

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.768
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT PLANNING
ON DOING ANYTHING.

00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:39.006
IT'S POSSIBLE THEY'RE
JUST TRYING TO PSYCHE YOU OUT.

00:07:39.072 --> 00:07:41.408
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU.

00:07:41.474 --> 00:07:43.576
NO MATTER WHAT,
YOU GOTTA STAY COOL.

00:07:43.643 --> 00:07:45.178
Eugeo: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:07:45.245 --> 00:07:47.547
‐ STAY WHAT, NOW?
‐ Kirito: OH, UH...

00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:50.450
THAT'S THE SECRET MANTRA
OF THE AINCRAD STYLE.

00:07:50.517 --> 00:07:53.886
IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
AS SAYING, "STAY CALM."

00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:56.423
YOU CAN ALSO USE IT
TO SAY GOODBYE TO SOMEONE.

00:07:56.489 --> 00:07:58.725
IT'S LIKE ANOTHER WAY
OF SAYING, "SEE YOU LATER."

00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:01.061
Eugeo: OH. OKAY!

00:08:01.128 --> 00:08:02.462
I'LL REMEMBER THAT.

00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:03.696
"STAY COOL."

00:08:03.763 --> 00:08:05.732
WHAT AN UNUSUAL THING TO SAY.

00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:07.167
STAY COOL? BIZARRE.

00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:09.002
Kirito: ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GO HIT THE SACK.

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:10.270
Eugeo: AND WHY "COOL"?

00:08:12.405 --> 00:08:14.507
Kirito: OH, HEY,
BY THE WAY, ABOUT TOMORROW,

00:08:14.574 --> 00:08:16.776
I HAVE TO RUN SOME ERRANDS,
SO YOU'RE ON YOUR‐‐

00:08:16.843 --> 00:08:18.411
Eugeo: OH, NO, YOU DON'T!

00:08:18.478 --> 00:08:21.414
WE PROMISED TIESE AND RONIE
WE'D TAKE THEM OUT FOR A PICNIC,

00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:23.516
AND BY "WE," I MEAN US,
SO IF YOU THINK

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:25.418
YOU CAN GET OUT OF IT,
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:26.819
( Kirito sighs )

00:08:26.886 --> 00:08:28.388
Eugeo: THEY'LL BE HERE
AT 9:00 SHARP,

00:08:28.455 --> 00:08:31.091
SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY
TO LEAVE BY THEN. YOU GOT IT?

00:08:31.158 --> 00:08:32.392
Kirito: OKAY, OKAY.

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:35.128
DO ME A FAVOR, THOUGH,
AND WAKE ME UP AT 8:00.

00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:37.130
I NEED TO CATCH UP
ON SOME SLEEP.

00:08:37.197 --> 00:08:38.998
Eugeo: NO! 8:00'S WAY TOO LATE!

00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:41.568
MAKE IT 7:30!

00:08:41.634 --> 00:08:42.935
AND STAY COOL.

00:08:43.003 --> 00:08:44.237
Kirito: I KNOW I TOLD YOU

00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:45.838
THAT PHRASE
IS LIKE SAYING, "BYE,"

00:08:45.905 --> 00:08:48.708
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU SAY
TO SOMEONE GOIN' TO BED.

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:49.776
Eugeo: WHY NOT?

00:08:49.842 --> 00:08:51.511
Kirito: 'CAUSE YOU DON'T.

00:08:51.578 --> 00:08:54.847
YOU USE IT WHEN YOU'RE REALLY
SAYING GOODBYE TO SOMEONE.

00:08:54.914 --> 00:08:56.149
Eugeo: OH.

00:08:56.216 --> 00:08:58.385
WHAT A COMPLICATED PHRASE.

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:12.165
IF WHAT KIRITO SAID IS TRUE,
ARE HUMBERT AND RAIOS CAPABLE

00:09:12.232 --> 00:09:15.335
OF SIDESTEPPING THE LAWS
OF THE AXIOM CHURCH?

00:09:15.402 --> 00:09:17.670
( sighs ) WHAT AM I SAYING?

00:09:18.938 --> 00:09:21.108
YOU CAN'T EVEN DOUBT
THE TABOO INDEX,

00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:22.709
MUCH LESS DISOBEY IT.

00:09:22.775 --> 00:09:25.278
IF THERE WERE A WAY AROUND IT,

00:09:25.345 --> 00:09:27.247
I COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING

00:09:27.314 --> 00:09:31.684
INSTEAD OF STAND THERE
AND WATCH ALICE GET TAKEN AWAY.

00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:35.455
WHY COULDN'T I DISOBEY
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE?

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:39.259
♪♪

00:09:42.429 --> 00:09:43.530
ALICE.

00:09:45.767 --> 00:09:48.070
( birds chirping )

00:09:48.137 --> 00:09:49.304
( frog chirping )

00:09:49.371 --> 00:09:51.973
Tiese: EUGEO, ARE YOU LISTENING?

00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:53.675
EUGEO?

00:09:53.742 --> 00:09:55.177
Eugeo: HUH? SORRY.

00:09:55.244 --> 00:09:58.180
I MISSED THAT LAST PART.
YOU WERE SAYING?

00:09:58.247 --> 00:09:59.914
( Tiese sighs )
YOU DIDN'T HEAR A SINGLE WORD.

00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:01.516
Eugeo: I'M SORRY. I JUST‐‐

00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:04.386
I WAS JUST ADMIRING
HOW BEAUTIFUL THE FOREST WAS.

00:10:04.453 --> 00:10:07.056
IT HAS ANIMALS
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

00:10:07.122 --> 00:10:08.090
Tiese: REALLY?

00:10:08.157 --> 00:10:10.459
Eugeo: YEAH, LIKE THAT ONE.

00:10:10.525 --> 00:10:13.695
Tiese: OH, THAT? THAT'S JUST
A PLAIN OLD GOLDEN FLYING FOX.

00:10:13.762 --> 00:10:15.730
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ONE.

00:10:15.797 --> 00:10:17.799
THEY'RE IN EVERY TREE
IN THE CAPITAL.

00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:20.502
Eugeo: OH, RIGHT.
I GUESS YOU'D BE USED TO THEM,

00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:22.304
SINCE YOU WERE BORN
AND RAISED HERE.

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:23.372
Tiese: THAT'S TRUE.

00:10:23.438 --> 00:10:24.973
Eugeo: DO YOUR FOLKS
LIVE NEARBY?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.608
Tiese: NO.
THEY LIVE IN DISTRICT EIGHT.

00:10:26.675 --> 00:10:29.778
IT'S A BIT OF A WAYS AWAY
FROM WHERE WE ARE IN FIVE.

00:10:29.844 --> 00:10:31.313
Eugeo: OH. YOU DON'T SAY.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.015
UH...

00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:36.018
HANG ON. IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

00:10:36.085 --> 00:10:38.487
DON'T YOU COME
FROM A FAMILY OF NOBLES?

00:10:38.553 --> 00:10:40.255
I THOUGHT ALL OF THE MANSIONS

00:10:40.322 --> 00:10:42.357
WERE IN DISTRICTS
THREE AND FOUR.

00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:44.459
Tiese: ONLY NOBLES
WHO ARE FOURTH RANK OR HIGHER

00:10:44.526 --> 00:10:45.994
GET TO LIVE IN THAT DISTRICT.

00:10:46.061 --> 00:10:48.530
MY FATHER IS
A SIXTH‐RANK NOBLEMAN.

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:51.200
THEREFORE, HE HAS
NO JUDICIAL AUTHORITY.

00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:52.601
Eugeo: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:54.703
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
SOMETHING EVERY NOBLE HAS.

00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:55.970
Tiese: CERTAINLY NOT!

00:10:56.038 --> 00:10:59.341
ONLY NOBLES FOURTH RANK OR
HIGHER ARE GRANTED THAT POWER,

00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:01.476
WHEREAS NOBLES WHO ARE
RANKED FIFTH AND LOWER

00:11:01.543 --> 00:11:04.813
MUST ADHERE TO THE JUDGMENT
OF THOSE OF HIGHER RANKING!

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:06.781
Eugeo: OH. INTERESTING.

00:11:08.383 --> 00:11:10.485
Tiese: UH, ANYWAY...

00:11:10.552 --> 00:11:12.254
THAT'S WHY SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF,

00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:14.256
AN HEIR TO A SIXTH‐RANK HOUSE,

00:11:14.323 --> 00:11:17.092
IS AN ARISTOCRAT IN NAME ONLY.

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:18.827
IN THAT SENSE, OUR LIFESTYLE

00:11:18.893 --> 00:11:21.263
IS REALLY NO DIFFERENT
FROM MOST PEOPLE'S.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.498
Eugeo: OH. REALLY?

00:11:23.565 --> 00:11:24.999
Kirito: OKAY,
SO IF YOUR OPPONENT

00:11:25.067 --> 00:11:26.668
WANTS TO GET THE DROP ON YOU
FROM ABOVE

00:11:26.735 --> 00:11:28.403
WITH A HIGH‐NORKIAN
STYLE ATTACK,

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.139
THERE'S TWO TYPES OF STRIKES

00:11:30.205 --> 00:11:32.841
YOU GOTTA BE READY
TO DEFEND YOURSELF AGAINST.

00:11:32.907 --> 00:11:35.044
THEY ARE A STRIKE FROM ABOVE

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.978
OR DIAGONALLY TO THE RIGHT.

00:11:37.046 --> 00:11:38.380
IF THEY DO ANYTHING ELSE,

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:40.349
THAT MEANS THEY'RE GONNA
SWITCH UP THEIR FOOTING,

00:11:40.415 --> 00:11:42.817
SO YOU'LL STILL
HAVE TIME TO BLOCK IT.

00:11:42.884 --> 00:11:44.019
( Eugeo chuckles )

00:11:44.086 --> 00:11:48.223
MAN, I'M STUFFED!

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:53.928
Tiese: UM, IF IT WOULD BE
ALL RIGHT WITH YOU TWO,

00:11:53.995 --> 00:11:56.865
WE'D LIKE TO GET
YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOMETHING.

00:11:56.931 --> 00:12:00.602
IT'S ABOUT FRENICA,
OUR ROOMMATE AT THE DORMITORY.

00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:01.903
( both sigh )

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.107
Ronie: THE ELITE DISCIPLE
WHOM SHE UNFORTUNATELY IS FORCED

00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:08.177
TO SERVE UNDER
IS A RATHER CRUDE INDIVIDUAL.

00:12:08.243 --> 00:12:09.811
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS,

00:12:09.878 --> 00:12:13.882
HE'S BEEN GIVING HER ORDERS THAT
GO WAY BEYOND INAPPROPRIATE.

00:12:13.948 --> 00:12:15.717
Eugeo: HIS RANKING IS NO EXCUSE.

00:12:15.784 --> 00:12:19.288
IF HE'S MAKING HER DO THINGS
THAT VIOLATE THE SCHOOL'S RULES,

00:12:19.354 --> 00:12:20.522
HE SHOULD BE REPORTED.

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:22.457
Tiese: THAT'S JUST IT.

00:12:22.524 --> 00:12:24.893
TECHNICALLY,
THEY'RE NOT VIOLATIONS,

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:28.897
BUT THE DEMANDS HE MAKES OF
A FEMALE STUDENT ARE SO OBSCENE.

00:12:28.963 --> 00:12:31.433
Eugeo: YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY ANY MORE.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.536
THE PROBLEM IS, THE ONLY WAY
TO CHANGE FRENICA'S MENTOR

00:12:34.603 --> 00:12:36.505
IS TO GET THE APPROVAL
OF HER CURRENT ONE.

00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:39.708
CAN YOU TELL US HIS NAME?

00:12:39.774 --> 00:12:42.577
( Tiese sighs ) YES.

00:12:42.644 --> 00:12:46.448
IT'S SECOND SEAT ELITE DISCIPLE,
HUMBERT ZIZEK.

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:48.050
Kirito: I'M NOT SURPRISED.

00:12:48.117 --> 00:12:49.584
( both gasp )

00:12:49.651 --> 00:12:52.854
Eugeo: A FEW DAYS AGO, I HAD
A SPARRING MATCH WITH HUMBERT

00:12:52.921 --> 00:12:55.790
IN THE TRAINING HALL.
WE ENDED IT IN A DRAW.

00:12:55.857 --> 00:12:59.694
IN FACT, HE SEEMED
PRETTY UPSET BY THAT.

00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:04.133
MY GUESS IS HE'S TAKING
HIS FRUSTRATIONS OUT ON FRENICA.

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:06.068
Ronie: HE'S DOING THIS
OUT OF REVENGE?

00:13:06.135 --> 00:13:08.337
HOW COULD HE BE SO CRUEL?

00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:10.839
Tiese: I JUST
CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

00:13:10.905 --> 00:13:15.510
WE LIVE IN A LARGER HOUSE
THAN MOST OTHER CIVILIANS

00:13:15.577 --> 00:13:18.080
AND ENJOY
SOME ADDITIONAL PRIVILEGES,

00:13:18.147 --> 00:13:20.315
BUT MY FATHER
WOULD ALWAYS REMIND ME

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:22.817
THAT WE SHOULD NEVER
TAKE THOSE THINGS FOR GRANTED.

00:13:22.884 --> 00:13:26.155
HE'D SAY WE WERE OBLIGED
TO ENSURE EVERYONE,

00:13:26.221 --> 00:13:27.489
NO MATTER THEIR STATION,

00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:30.125
COULD LIVE
A HAPPY AND PEACEFUL LIFE.

00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:32.761
AND IF WAR BROKE OUT,
IT'S OUR DUTY

00:13:32.827 --> 00:13:36.398
TO TAKE UP OUR SWORDS FIRST
AND PROTECT THE WEAK.

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:38.933
AND YET,
BECAUSE OF THE HEARTLESS ORDERS

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.769
THAT WERE ISSUED BY A NOBLE,

00:13:40.835 --> 00:13:44.073
FRENICA COULDN'T HELP BUT CRY
HERSELF TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:48.743
IT'S NOT RIGHT. HOW CAN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BE ALLOWED?

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.979
( sighs )

00:13:51.046 --> 00:13:52.547
THANK YOU.

00:13:53.982 --> 00:13:55.850
Kirito: THERE'S A PHRASE
IN THE SACRED TONGUE

00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:57.086
THAT COMES TO MIND,

00:13:57.152 --> 00:13:58.720
WHICH‐‐LET'S SEE.

00:13:58.787 --> 00:14:03.258
IT'S PRONOUNCED
NOBLESSE OBLIGE, I THINK.

00:14:03.325 --> 00:14:07.496
BASICALLY IT MEANS
WHOEVER'S GOT THE POWER

00:14:07.562 --> 00:14:09.664
SHOULD USE IT
FOR THE SAKE OF THE VULNERABLE,

00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:12.201
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER SAID.

00:14:12.267 --> 00:14:14.236
IT'S A CODE OF HONOR,

00:14:14.303 --> 00:14:17.272
AND THAT KIND OF HONOR
IS MORE IMPORTANT

00:14:17.339 --> 00:14:19.974
THAN ANY LAW OR CUSTOM.

00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:22.311
THERE ARE THINGS
YOU JUST SHOULDN'T DO,

00:14:22.377 --> 00:14:24.446
EVEN IF THERE'S
NO LAW AGAINST 'EM.

00:14:24.513 --> 00:14:28.683
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE MIGHT
BE STUFF YOU SHOULD DO,

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.586
EVEN IF THE LAWS
SAY YOU SHOULDN'T.

00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:34.956
Ronie: I THINK I UNDERSTAND

00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:36.491
WHAT IT IS YOU'RE SAYING.

00:14:36.558 --> 00:14:38.593
IF I'M HEARING YOU CORRECTLY...

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.463
THE TABOO INDEX
DOESN'T COVER EVERYTHING.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.598
IN CASES LIKE THIS ONE,

00:14:43.665 --> 00:14:46.235
WE HAVE TO USE
OUR OWN PERSONAL SENSE

00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:47.602
OF WHAT'S RIGHT
AND WHAT'S WRONG.

00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:49.938
INSTEAD OF BLINDLY OBEYING LAWS,

00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:54.409
WE NEED TO ASK WHY THEY EXIST
AND IF THEY'RE EVEN HONORABLE.

00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:55.610
THAT SELF‐REFLECTION

00:14:55.677 --> 00:14:58.680
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN JUST BLIND FAITH.

00:14:58.747 --> 00:15:01.083
Kirito: YUP!
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.551
IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO LEARN

00:15:02.617 --> 00:15:04.386
HOW TO ACT AND THINK
FOR YOURSELF.

00:15:04.453 --> 00:15:06.388
THAT'S WORTH MORE
THAN THE BEST SWORD

00:15:06.455 --> 00:15:08.090
OR THE FLASHIEST MOVE.

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:11.560
EVEN THOUGH HUMBERT DIDN'T
TECHNICALLY BREAK THE RULES,

00:15:11.626 --> 00:15:13.895
WHAT HE DID IS STILL 100% WRONG.

00:15:13.962 --> 00:15:17.499
SOMEONE'S GOTTA HOLD HIM
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT.

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:20.635
IN THIS CASE, IT LOOKS
LIKE IT'S UP TO US TO.

00:15:20.702 --> 00:15:24.973
Eugeo: RIGHT.
WE'LL GO AND SORT THIS OUT.

00:15:27.078 --> 00:15:28.779
Raios: WELL, WELL.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:33.084
TO WHAT DO WE OWE THE PLEASURE
OF THIS VISIT, DISCIPLE EUGEO?

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.952
AND ON THE EVENING
OF OUR DAY OF REST, NO LESS.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.556
Eugeo: I'VE COME TO REPORT
A TROUBLING RUMOR.

00:15:39.623 --> 00:15:42.526
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT CONCERNS DISCIPLE ZIZEK.

00:15:42.593 --> 00:15:44.928
I THOUGHT I'D BRING THIS
TO YOUR ATTENTION

00:15:44.995 --> 00:15:47.698
BEFORE IT DAMAGED
HIS STELLAR REPUTATION.

00:15:47.764 --> 00:15:49.466
Humbert: ARE YOU MOCKING ME?!

00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:51.335
Raios: OH, MY.

00:15:51.402 --> 00:15:52.869
I MUST SAY I'M SURPRISED.

00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:55.406
I WOULDN'T HAVE
EXPECTED THIS FROM YOU.

00:15:55.472 --> 00:15:57.474
HOW THOUGHTFUL OF YOU
TO BE CONCERNED

00:15:57.541 --> 00:15:59.776
FOR THE SAKE
OF MY FRIEND'S GOOD NAME.

00:15:59.843 --> 00:16:02.646
HOWEVER, I'M AFRAID
I HAVE NO IDEA

00:16:02.713 --> 00:16:05.682
WHAT THIS RUMOR
YOU SPEAK OF COULD BE.

00:16:08.985 --> 00:16:11.388
ALONG WITH THE NATURE
OF THESE CLAIMS,

00:16:11.455 --> 00:16:13.890
I MUST ASK WHERE YOU
ACQUIRED THIS INFORMATION.

00:16:13.957 --> 00:16:15.659
Eugeo: FROM LORD ZIZEK'S PAGE,

00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:17.961
ALONG WITH THE GIRLS
WHO ROOM WITH HER.

00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:19.763
AS FAR AS THE CLAIMS
ARE CONCERNED,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.567
THEY SAY LORD ZIZEK
HAS BEEN ISSUING PERVERSE ORDERS

00:16:23.634 --> 00:16:26.070
TO HIS PAGE, FRENICA.

00:16:26.137 --> 00:16:28.272
Raios: WHAT ARE
THESE "PERVERSE ORDERS"?

00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:31.542
I'M NOT FOLLOWING WHAT IT IS
YOU'RE GETTING AT, SIR EUGEO.

00:16:31.608 --> 00:16:34.078
WHICH OF THE SCHOOL'S
REGULATIONS

00:16:34.145 --> 00:16:36.147
HAS HE VIOLATED SPECIFICALLY?

00:16:36.213 --> 00:16:37.448
( Eugeo gasps )

00:16:37.514 --> 00:16:39.016
( sighs )

00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:42.819
SIR, EVEN IF SOMETHING ISN'T
SPECIFICALLY FORBIDDEN HERE,

00:16:42.886 --> 00:16:45.622
DO YOU NOT AGREE THERE ARE
THINGS AN ELITE DISCIPLE

00:16:45.689 --> 00:16:48.025
SHOULD NEVER DO
AS A PRIMARY TRAINEE'S MENTOR?

00:16:48.092 --> 00:16:51.428
Raios: OH, HO!
I CAN TELL THIS UPSETS YOU.

00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:53.864
NOW THEN, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU INSINUATING

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.333
HUMBERT FORCED FRENICA TO DO?

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.934
Eugeo: I COULDN'T SAY.

00:16:58.002 --> 00:17:01.038
Raios: WELL,
WHAT SAY YOU, HUMBERT?

00:17:01.105 --> 00:17:02.106
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

00:17:02.173 --> 00:17:04.875
WHAT IT IS SIR EUGEO
COULD BE REFERRING TO?

00:17:06.543 --> 00:17:08.079
Humbert: NOT EVEN THE FOGGIEST!

00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:11.782
TRY AS I MIGHT, I CAN'T MAKE
HEADS NOR TAILS OF IT.

00:17:11.848 --> 00:17:13.650
IT IS TRUE THAT I ASKED HER

00:17:13.717 --> 00:17:15.786
TO PERFORM
SOME MENIAL TASKS FOR ME.

00:17:15.852 --> 00:17:18.222
BUT EVER SINCE MY DUEL
WITH SIR EUGEO,

00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:21.925
WHICH REGRETTABLY ENDED
IN A DRAW, I'M A CHANGED MAN

00:17:21.992 --> 00:17:24.895
AND HAVE IMMERSED MYSELF
FULLY IN MY TRAINING!

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:28.099
WHY, I'VE BEEN USING MUSCLES
I DID NOT KNOW I HAD,

00:17:28.165 --> 00:17:31.002
AND, AS A RESULT,
MY BODY ACHED SO BADLY.

00:17:31.068 --> 00:17:33.270
IN SUCH A HUMBLED STATE
AS I WAS IN,

00:17:33.337 --> 00:17:35.106
I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ASK HER

00:17:35.172 --> 00:17:37.408
TO MASSAGE ME EVERY NIGHT
WHILE I BATHED.

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:38.809
( Eugeo gasps )

00:17:38.875 --> 00:17:40.677
Humbert: I WAS CONCERNED
SHE WOULD SOIL HER UNIFORM,

00:17:40.744 --> 00:17:42.813
SO I GRACIOUSLY
HAD HER STRIP DOWN

00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:44.648
AND MASSAGE ME
IN HER UNDERGARMENTS.

00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:47.684
HONESTLY, I CAN'T
FOR THE LIFE OF ME UNDERSTAND

00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:50.221
HOW ANYONE
COULD THINK THAT PERVERSE.

00:17:53.957 --> 00:17:58.229
Eugeo: BECAUSE OF YOUR BEHAVIOR,
FRENICA HAS BEEN BESIDE HERSELF.

00:17:58.295 --> 00:18:01.532
IF YOU CONTINUE HARASSING HER,
I WILL BE FORCED

00:18:01.598 --> 00:18:04.535
TO BRING IT TO THE ATTENTION
OF OUR INSTRUCTORS.

00:18:04.601 --> 00:18:05.802
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:18:05.869 --> 00:18:08.072

00:18:27.258 --> 00:18:29.893
Kirito: LUCKY FOR THEM,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOUR SWORD.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.029
WELL, AT LEAST,
NOW I'M PRETTY SURE

00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:34.798
THEY'RE UP TO SOMETHING MORE
THAN JUST BEING CREEPS.

‐ Eugeo: WHAT?
‐ Kirito: I GET THE FEELING

00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:38.635
THE REASON THEY'RE GOING
TO ALL THIS TROUBLE

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.271
IS TO SET A TRAP FOR YOU.

00:18:40.337 --> 00:18:41.305
Eugeo: REALLY?

00:18:41.372 --> 00:18:42.906
Kirito: YEAH. LOOK,

00:18:42.973 --> 00:18:45.976
IF YOU'D TAKEN THEIR BAIT AND
STARTED GOING OFF ON HUMBERT,

00:18:46.043 --> 00:18:49.213
THEY COULD HAVE ACCUSED YOU
OF BEING DISRESPECTFUL TO THEM,

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.383
AND THEY'D BE IN THEIR RIGHTS
TO PUNISH YOU. YOU SEE?

00:18:52.449 --> 00:18:54.385
( Eugeo sighs )

00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:57.288
( Kirito sighs ) DON'T WORRY.

00:18:57.354 --> 00:19:01.092
IF HUMBERT DOESN'T STOP
MESSING WITH FRENICA, HE'LL PAY.

00:19:01.158 --> 00:19:03.760
FOR NOW, ALL WE CAN DO

00:19:03.827 --> 00:19:06.030

00:19:07.164 --> 00:19:08.832
