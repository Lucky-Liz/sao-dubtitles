THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH,

00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:23.238

THIS CALLING ONTO YOU.

OF THE WORLD OUTSIDE THIS SHAFT.

THEREFORE, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT NEW CALLING I WOULD CHOOSE.

ALTHOUGH, IF I COULD WISH
FOR ANYTHING ELSE TO DO...

EVEN IF YOU STOPPED A PERSON

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.942
FROM AGING WITH A SACRED ART,

00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:36.912
THERE'S NO WAY
TO STOP THEIR SOUL FROM AGING.

IT FALLS APART.
