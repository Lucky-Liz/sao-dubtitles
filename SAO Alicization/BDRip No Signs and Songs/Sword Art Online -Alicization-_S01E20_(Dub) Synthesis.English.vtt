‐ WHAT THE HELL?
‐ ( Alice gasps )

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:36.807
BUT HOW?

00:18:36.874 --> 00:18:37.808
IT'S TOO SOON.

00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:39.943
Kirito: TOO SOON FOR WHAT?!

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.812
Alice: THE SYNTHESIS RITUAL.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.715
YOUR FRIEND EUGEO

00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:48.519
SEEMS TO HAVE
ALREADY BEEN SYNTHESIZED.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.988
Kirito: HE IS?

00:18:51.054 --> 00:18:52.322
NO WAY. YOU SURE?

00:18:52.389 --> 00:18:55.726
Alice: I AM. I DO NOT KNOW
HOW IT IS POSSIBLE.

00:18:55.793 --> 00:18:58.428
HE FOUGHT THE COMMANDER
ONLY AN HOUR AGO.

00:18:58.495 --> 00:19:02.065
Kirito: THEN, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

00:19:02.132 --> 00:19:03.667
‐ Alice: WAIT.
‐ Kirito: NOT HIM.

00:19:03.734 --> 00:19:05.669
Alice: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:19:05.736 --> 00:19:07.470
DO NOT LOSE YOUR WITS NOW.

00:19:07.538 --> 00:19:10.140
THERE IS STILL A CHANCE
WE CAN SAVE EUGEO!

00:19:10.207 --> 00:19:11.942
‐ Kirito: THERE IS?
‐ Alice: YES.

00:19:12.009 --> 00:19:14.444
YOU TOLD ME SO YOURSELF.

00:19:14.512 --> 00:19:18.115
YOU DISCOVERED A WAY TO RESTORE
AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT'S MEMORIES.

00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:21.084
THEREFORE, IT SHOULD
APPLY TO HIM AS WELL.

00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:23.153
THE IMPORTANT THING NOW

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.422
IS YOU STAY CALM
AND GET HOLD OF YOURSELF.

00:19:25.488 --> 00:19:28.425
Kirito: YEAH. ( grunts )

00:19:30.694 --> 00:19:32.429
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

00:19:33.296 --> 00:19:34.732
Alice: AS YOU WISH.

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:38.001
BE CAREFUL. HE IS NOT
THE PERSON YOU ONCE KNEW.

00:19:38.068 --> 00:19:39.737
Kirito: RIGHT.

00:19:41.605 --> 00:19:44.742
EUGEO, YOU REMEMBER WHO I AM?

00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:47.511
I'M KIRITO.
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

00:19:47.578 --> 00:19:52.482
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER EVER SINCE
WE LEFT RULID TWO YEARS AGO.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.918
Eugeo: I'M SORRY.

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:56.920
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:58.889
THANK YOU, THOUGH.

00:19:58.956 --> 00:20:00.457
Kirito: UH, FOR WHAT?

00:20:00.524 --> 00:20:02.960
Eugeo: FOR RETURNING
MY SWORD TO ME.

00:20:03.026 --> 00:20:03.961
Kirito: HUH?

00:20:04.027 --> 00:20:05.763
( tone chimes )

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:07.197
( both gasp )

00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:13.537
Alice: INCARNATE ARMS.

00:20:13.604 --> 00:20:15.105
Kirito: HOW'D HE DO THAT?!

00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.875
Alice: HE USED AN ANCIENT ART
TAUGHT TO INTEGRITY KNIGHTS.

00:20:17.941 --> 00:20:21.211
IT IS NEITHER SACRED ART,
NOR A PERFECT CONTROL.

00:20:21.278 --> 00:20:24.548
IT ALLOWS ONE
TO MOVE OBJECTS AT WILL.

00:20:24.615 --> 00:20:27.017
ONLY A HANDFUL OF KNIGHTS,
INCLUDING UNCLE,

00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:29.119
HAVE THE SKILL
TO USE IT, THOUGH.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.788
IT IS NOT SOMETHING

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:34.658
A NEWLY CREATED KNIGHT
LIKE EUGEO COULD HAVE MASTERED.

00:20:35.793 --> 00:20:38.696
Kirito: OKAY, YOU GOT IT BACK.
SO NOW WHAT?

00:20:38.762 --> 00:20:42.065
Eugeo: I WILL FIGHT
THE BOTH OF YOU.

00:20:42.132 --> 00:20:43.734
IT IS WHAT MY LADY WISHES.

00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:46.303
Kirito: OH, COME ON!
YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT ME,

00:20:46.369 --> 00:20:48.906
YOUR FRIEND,
ALL 'CAUSE SHE TOLD YOU TO?!

00:20:48.972 --> 00:20:50.508
THAT'S NO REASON TO FIGHT!

00:20:50.574 --> 00:20:53.143
Eugeo: IT IS
REASON ENOUGH FOR ME.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.379
SHE GIVES ME
EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED,

00:20:56.446 --> 00:20:58.582
AND SHE IS ALL
I'LL EVER NEED NOW.

00:20:58.649 --> 00:21:00.984
‐ Kirito: OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.
‐ ( Eugeo gasps )

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:03.654
Kirito: WHAT ABOUT ALICE?!
DO YOU REMEMBER HER?!

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:04.888
( Eugeo grunts )

00:21:04.955 --> 00:21:06.223
( sighs )

00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:09.693
I DON'T, AND I DON'T WANT TO.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.262
I DON'T CARE
WHO EITHER OF YOU ARE.

00:21:12.329 --> 00:21:13.531
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

00:21:13.597 --> 00:21:14.998
Kirito: SNAP OUT OF IT.

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:17.000
( boots thudding )

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:28.912
Eugeo: ARM YOURSELF.
I AM DONE TALKING.

00:21:28.979 --> 00:21:30.648
♪♪

00:21:35.485 --> 00:21:37.487
Kirito: YOU DON'T REMEMBER,

00:21:37.555 --> 00:21:40.691
BUT I'M THE ONE WHO TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO FIGHT WITH A SWORD.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.361
KEEP THAT IN MIND,

00:21:44.427 --> 00:21:46.797
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT TO TEACH YOU
ANOTHER LESSON.

00:21:58.175 --> 00:21:59.309
( both exhale )

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:03.547
