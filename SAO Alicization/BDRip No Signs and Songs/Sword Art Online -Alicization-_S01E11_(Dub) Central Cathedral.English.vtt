Eugeo: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT COULD BE.

00:11:21.365 --> 00:11:23.634
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.437
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO BREAK OUT OF THIS CELL

00:11:26.503 --> 00:11:28.672
AND THEN FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALICE.

00:11:28.739 --> 00:11:30.007
Kirito: YEAH.

00:11:30.074 --> 00:11:33.210
IF THERE'S A WAY OUT
OF THIS PLACE, WE'LL FIND IT.

00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:35.346
Eugeo: I WONDER...

00:11:35.412 --> 00:11:38.215
DID THEY BRING ALICE HERE
EIGHT YEARS AGO?

00:11:38.282 --> 00:11:39.816
Kirito: I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

00:11:39.883 --> 00:11:41.352
( sighs )

00:11:41.418 --> 00:11:43.220
SINCE YOU BROUGHT HER UP,

00:11:43.287 --> 00:11:45.589
I JUST WANNA BE SURE
OF SOMETHING.

00:11:45.656 --> 00:11:49.426
THE KNIGHT THAT CALLS HERSELF
ALICE SYNTHESIS THIRTY,

00:11:49.493 --> 00:11:51.062
YOU'RE POSITIVE THAT SHE'S

00:11:51.128 --> 00:11:53.330
THE SAME ALICE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

00:11:53.397 --> 00:11:54.698
Eugeo: YEAH, I AM.

00:11:54.765 --> 00:11:58.135
THOSE BLUE EYES,
GOLDEN HAIR, AND THAT VOICE,

00:11:58.202 --> 00:11:59.570
I'D NEVER FORGET THEM.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.306
BUT SHE SEEMED LIKE
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON.

00:12:02.373 --> 00:12:03.807
Kirito: FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE

00:12:03.874 --> 00:12:06.610
YOUR CHILDHOOD FRIEND,
SHE WHACKED YOU PRETTY GOOD.

00:12:06.677 --> 00:12:09.013
BUT IF YOU WANT MY OPINION,
IT COULD BE

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.682
SHE'S UNDER SOME KIND
OF MIND CONTROL OR SOMETHING.

00:12:11.748 --> 00:12:13.850
Eugeo: BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
SEEING SPELLS LIKE THAT

00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:15.086
IN ANY OF OUR TEXTBOOKS.

00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:17.088
Kirito: RIGHT,
BUT THE HIGH‐RANKING PRIESTS

00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:19.456
IN THE CHURCH
CAN MANIPULATE LIFE.

00:12:19.523 --> 00:12:23.160
IF THEY CAN DO THAT, THEY CAN
CONTROL SOMEONE'S MIND, TOO.

00:12:23.227 --> 00:12:26.430
ALTHOUGH, IF THAT KNIGHT
REALLY IS YOUR ALICE,

00:12:26.497 --> 00:12:28.832
WHOSE VOICE DID I HEAR...

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:32.069
TWO YEARS AGO IN THE CAVE?

00:12:32.136 --> 00:12:36.207
Girl: KIRITO, EUGEO,
COME AND FIND ME.

00:12:36.273 --> 00:12:37.708
I AM WAITING...

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.646
AT THE TOP
OF THE CENTRAL CATHEDRAL.

00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:48.585
I WILL WAIT THERE FOR YOU BOTH.

00:12:48.652 --> 00:12:51.355
Eugeo: RIGHT. YOU TOLD ME THAT.

00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:53.224
WHEN YOU AND SELKA
WERE HEALING ME,

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.658
YOU SAID YOU HEARD A VOICE

00:12:54.725 --> 00:12:56.593
AND THEN SAW SOMETHING
THAT LOOKED LIKE ALICE.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.662
Kirito: YEAH.
SHE SAID SHE'D WAIT FOR US

00:12:58.729 --> 00:13:00.797
AT THE TOP
OF THE CENTRAL CATHEDRAL.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:03.767
AND NOW WE'RE STUCK.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:07.938
( gasps )

00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:11.742
HEY, DO YOU THINK
WE CAN ACCESS

00:13:11.808 --> 00:13:13.377
THE STACIA WINDOWS
ON THESE CHAINS?

00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:15.946
Eugeo: I NEVER EVEN
THOUGHT TO TRY THAT.

00:13:16.013 --> 00:13:17.214
GIVE IT A SHOT.

00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:18.415
Kirito: 'KAY.

00:13:22.353 --> 00:13:24.321
WHOA. IT WORKED.

00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:30.894
Eugeo: AH, WE COULD PULL
ON THESE CHAINS FOREVER,

00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:32.263
AND THEY'D NEVER BUDGE.

00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:34.465
IF WE'RE GOING
TO BREAK FREE OF THEM,

00:13:34.531 --> 00:13:37.134
WE NEED TO GET OUR HANDS
ON A TOOL OR WEAPON

00:13:37.201 --> 00:13:38.969
THAT'S AT LEAST CLASS 38.

00:13:40.037 --> 00:13:41.072
( Kirito grunts )

00:13:41.138 --> 00:13:43.474
YEAH, THAT WON'T DO ANYTHING.

00:13:46.343 --> 00:13:47.844
( sighs )

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.513
Eugeo: I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.082
BUT THE ONLY THINGS
WE HAVE IN HERE

00:13:51.148 --> 00:13:54.218
ARE A COUPLE OF BEDS,
WATER SKINS, AND THESE CHAINS.

00:13:54.285 --> 00:13:57.188
Kirito: A PAIR OF CHAINS.

00:13:57.254 --> 00:13:58.189
( grunts )

00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:00.057
Eugeo: UH...

00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:04.861
Kirito: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE GOT THESE CHAINS,

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:06.263
TWO OF THESE SUCKERS,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.731
JUST WHAT WE NEED.

00:14:07.798 --> 00:14:09.400
Eugeo: WHAT?

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:11.535
( chains clinking )

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.012
HANG ON. I HAVE A QUESTION.

00:14:21.078 --> 00:14:24.215
IS YOUR IDEA TO USE THE CHAINS
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER?

00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:25.816
Kirito: IT TOTALLY IS.

00:14:25.882 --> 00:14:28.519
THESE CHAINS OF OURS HAVE
THE SAME DURABILITY LEVEL.

00:14:28.585 --> 00:14:30.021
WE'D NEED SOMETHING

00:14:30.087 --> 00:14:33.457
WITH AN OBJECT CONTROL AUTHORITY
OVER 40 TO BREAK 'EM,

00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:35.359
BUT IF WE SNAP 'EM
AGAINST EACH OTHER,

00:14:35.426 --> 00:14:37.394
THAT SHOULD WEAR 'EM DOWN.

00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:39.030
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD, OKAY?

00:14:39.096 --> 00:14:40.531
Eugeo: UH...

00:14:44.435 --> 00:14:45.902
Kirito: READY, AND...

00:14:49.006 --> 00:14:49.940
HELL, YEAH!

00:14:50.007 --> 00:14:51.008
Eugeo: NOT SO LOUD!

00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:52.876
‐ YOU'LL WAKE THE GUARD UP!
‐ Kirito: UH...

00:14:55.146 --> 00:14:56.447
( guard snoring )

00:14:56.513 --> 00:14:58.015
( mutters )

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:00.751
( both sigh )

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.953
Kirito: LET'S GIVE IT
ANOTHER TRY.

00:15:04.455 --> 00:15:07.591
Both: READY, AND...

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.194
( Kirito groans )

00:15:10.261 --> 00:15:11.762
( Eugeo groans )

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.568
I THINK THAT KNOCKED
AT LEAST 100 POINTS OFF MY LIFE.

00:15:17.634 --> 00:15:19.336
Kirito:
THAT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

00:15:19.403 --> 00:15:21.038
FOR FREEDOM, WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

00:15:21.105 --> 00:15:22.139
THINGS ARE LOOKIN' UP.

00:15:22.206 --> 00:15:23.607
Eugeo: MM‐HMM.

00:15:26.377 --> 00:15:28.045
Kirito: ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:15:30.814 --> 00:15:34.251
IF WE DO THIS,
THERE'S NO GOING BACK FOR US.

00:15:34.318 --> 00:15:36.720
REMEMBER,
BY BREAKING OUT OF THIS CELL

00:15:36.787 --> 00:15:39.190
AND LOOKING
FOR THE TRUTH ABOUT ALICE,

00:15:39.256 --> 00:15:43.060
WE'RE DEFYING THE AXIOM CHURCH
AND ITS LAWS.

00:15:43.127 --> 00:15:45.929
THAT MEANS FROM NOW ON,
THERE'S NO TIME

00:15:45.996 --> 00:15:48.699
FOR SECOND‐GUESSING
OR HESITATION.

00:15:48.765 --> 00:15:52.369
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE
YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THAT NOW.

00:15:52.436 --> 00:15:54.071
OTHERWISE,
YOU SHOULD STAY HERE.

00:15:55.672 --> 00:15:57.474
Eugeo: YEAH, I KNOW.

00:15:57.541 --> 00:16:00.244
BUT MY MIND'S MADE UP.

00:16:00.311 --> 00:16:02.379
IF I CAN RETURN HOME WITH ALICE,

00:16:02.446 --> 00:16:05.182
DEFYING THE CHURCH
ISN'T EVEN A QUESTION.

00:16:05.249 --> 00:16:08.252
I'LL EVEN DRAW MY SWORD
AGAINST THEM IF I HAVE TO.

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:12.789
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT KNIGHT
IS ALICE, AND, IF SHE IS,

00:16:12.856 --> 00:16:15.826
I'LL FIND A WAY TO CHANGE HER
BACK TO THE WAY SHE WAS.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.162
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS TO ME,

00:16:18.229 --> 00:16:20.231
AND NOTHING WILL STOP ME.

00:16:20.297 --> 00:16:21.365
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID

00:16:21.432 --> 00:16:24.235
ON THAT PICNIC
WITH RONIE AND TIESE?

00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:25.769
"THERE ARE THINGS YOU SHOULD DO,

00:16:25.836 --> 00:16:27.604
EVEN IF THE LAWS
SAY YOU SHOULDN'T."

00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:31.442
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEANT BY THAT NOW.

00:16:32.476 --> 00:16:33.744
Kirito: ALL RIGHT.

00:16:38.615 --> 00:16:42.886
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE READY,
SO LET'S GO GIVE 'EM SOME HELL.

00:16:51.295 --> 00:16:52.229
( yells )

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.402
SWEET. LET'S GO
BEFORE THE GUARD WAKES UP.

00:16:58.469 --> 00:16:59.403
Eugeo: RIGHT.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.572

00:17:06.043 --> 00:17:07.511

♪♪

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.885
( Kirito sighs ) DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE ANYONE'S FOLLOWING US.

00:17:48.952 --> 00:17:50.554
Eugeo: NO WAY. LOOK AT THAT!

00:17:50.621 --> 00:17:52.223
Kirito: WHAT'S UP?
IS SOMEONE COMING?

00:17:53.524 --> 00:17:55.259
Eugeo: SEE THESE FLOWERS?

00:17:56.327 --> 00:17:57.428
I'VE HEARD OF THEM.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:00.797
KIRITO, THESE ARE ROSES.

00:18:00.864 --> 00:18:03.367
Kirito: OH, YEAH. HUH.

00:18:03.434 --> 00:18:05.836
NO WAY! THEY ARE ROSES,

00:18:05.902 --> 00:18:07.938
AND THIS PLACE
IS CHOCK‐FULL OF 'EM!

00:18:08.005 --> 00:18:10.707
Eugeo: IT'S RARE TO FIND ONE,
BUT A WHOLE GARDEN FULL...

00:18:12.143 --> 00:18:14.311
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE STANDING HERE.

00:18:14.378 --> 00:18:18.049
YOU AND I ACTUALLY MADE IT
TO THE CENTRAL CATHEDRAL.

00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:21.152
Kirito: YEAH. WE'RE CRIMINALS,
NOT INTEGRITY KNIGHTS,

00:18:21.218 --> 00:18:23.354
BUT WE'RE HERE,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.855
Eugeo: IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST

00:18:24.921 --> 00:18:26.590
THAT THINGS WORKED OUT THIS WAY.

00:18:26.657 --> 00:18:28.459
IF WE HAD BECOME
INTEGRITY KNIGHTS,

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.127
WE MIGHT HAVE
ENDED UP LIKE ALICE.

00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:32.396
Kirito: THEY COULD HAVE
GOTTEN IN OUR HEADS

00:18:32.463 --> 00:18:34.065
AND SCREWED
WITH OUR MEMORIES, TOO.

00:18:34.131 --> 00:18:37.334
I WONDER, IF THEY DO THAT
TO ALL THE INTEGRITY KNIGHTS,

00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:42.106
DO THEY FORGET EVERYTHING
ABOUT WHO THEY WERE BEFORE?

00:18:42.173 --> 00:18:43.307
Eugeo: WHO KNOWS?

00:18:43.374 --> 00:18:46.077
Kirito: YEAH, WELL,
EVEN IF A KNIGHT'S MEMORIES

00:18:46.143 --> 00:18:48.612
GOT BLOCKED SOMEHOW,
THEY'D AT LEAST REMEMBER

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:51.915
THEIR PARENTS OR
THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE BORN.

00:18:51.982 --> 00:18:54.685
STUFF LIKE THAT'S
BAKED INTO A PERSON'S SOUL.

00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:56.587
IT'D BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SWAP OUT

00:18:56.653 --> 00:18:58.689
THOSE KIND OF DETAILS
WITH FAKE ONES.

00:18:58.755 --> 00:19:00.091
Eugeo: YOU HAVE A POINT.

00:19:00.157 --> 00:19:03.594
THOSE FAKE MEMORIES
WOULD LIKELY BE TENUOUS AT BEST.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.962
WHAT IF THEY WERE
FLYING AROUND WHILE ON DUTY

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.432
AND CAME UPON
THE PLACE THEY GREW UP?

00:19:08.499 --> 00:19:10.667
ONCE THEY SAW IT,
THEY WOULD KNOW,

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:12.969
AND ALL THEIR MEMORIES
WOULD COME‐‐( gasps )

00:19:14.471 --> 00:19:15.806
Kirito: WHAT?

00:19:15.872 --> 00:19:18.175
( sighs ) NOT AGAIN.

00:19:18.242 --> 00:19:20.377
‐ ( Eugeo gasps )
‐ ( Kirito chuckles )

00:19:20.444 --> 00:19:22.046
I GET IT!

00:19:22.113 --> 00:19:23.480
YOU'RE WORRIED I'LL FIND A WAY

00:19:23.547 --> 00:19:26.150
TO GET MY MEMORIES BACK
IN THAT TOWER, AREN'T YOU?

00:19:26.217 --> 00:19:27.251
Eugeo: NO!

00:19:27.318 --> 00:19:30.121
WELL, A LITTLE. ( sighs )

00:19:30.187 --> 00:19:31.488
( Kirito chuckles )

00:19:31.555 --> 00:19:32.889
WOULD YOU RELAX?!

00:19:32.956 --> 00:19:35.926
Eugeo: DON'T!
STOP IT! LET ME GO!

00:19:35.992 --> 00:19:38.895
Kirito: MAN, I TOLD YOU BEFORE
NOT TO WORRY, AND I MEANT IT.

00:19:38.962 --> 00:19:42.499
WHETHER I GET MY MEMORIES BACK
OR NOT, WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM,

00:19:42.566 --> 00:19:44.468
SO WE'RE STICKIN' TOGETHER
'TIL THE END.

00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:45.936
( Eugeo sighs )

00:19:46.003 --> 00:19:47.871
STOP TREATING ME LIKE A KID.

00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:50.774
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T TRUST YOU
TO KEEP YOUR WORD.

00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:54.078
YOU'VE ONLY MENTIONED IT
A MILLION TIMES SO FAR.

00:19:54.145 --> 00:19:57.014
BUT WHEN I THINK
ABOUT HOW OUR JOURNEY

00:19:57.081 --> 00:20:02.119
MIGHT BE COMING TO AN END,
I FEEL‐‐I DON'T KNOW.

00:20:02.186 --> 00:20:06.157
Kirito: THE FACT IS
IT'S GONNA END ONE DAY,

00:20:06.223 --> 00:20:08.159
BUT DON'T FORGET
WHAT THAT'S GONNA MEAN.

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:11.128
YOU'LL GET ALICE'S MEMORY BACK,

00:20:11.195 --> 00:20:13.330
AND THEN YOU'RE
GONNA TAKE HER HOME.

00:20:15.066 --> 00:20:17.168
THERE'S ANOTHER GOOD THING
THAT'LL COME OUT OF IT.

00:20:17.234 --> 00:20:18.769
YOU'LL GET TO PICK
ANOTHER CALLING.

00:20:18.835 --> 00:20:21.205
IT MIGHT LAST
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

00:20:21.272 --> 00:20:24.308
SO YOU BETTER START THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT.

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:27.578
Eugeo: I THINK I STILL HAVE
A BIT OF TIME TO DECIDE.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:28.912
I KNOW WHATEVER I PICK

00:20:28.979 --> 00:20:30.947
WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH WOODCUTTING.

00:20:31.015 --> 00:20:32.849
( Kirito laughs )
NO SURPRISE THERE.

00:20:32.916 --> 00:20:34.685
COME ON. LET'S GET GOING.

00:20:46.997 --> 00:20:48.765
‐ Man: AS EXPECTED.
‐ ( both gasp )

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:51.402
Man: I HAVE TO ADMIRE
MY LADY ALICE'S WISDOM.

00:20:51.468 --> 00:20:54.971
EVERYONE THOUGHT ESCAPE
FROM THAT PRISON WAS IMPOSSIBLE,

00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:57.174
AND YET MY MENTOR PREDICTED IT.

00:20:57.241 --> 00:20:58.842
Kirito: MENTOR?

00:20:58.909 --> 00:21:01.612
Man: SHE ORDERED ME
TO CAMP OUT HERE FOR THE NIGHT

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:04.215
IN ANTICIPATION
OF YOUR BREAKOUT.

00:21:04.281 --> 00:21:07.351
TO BE HONEST,
I WAS SKEPTICAL YOU'D SHOW UP,

00:21:07.418 --> 00:21:09.353
AND, OH, HOW WRONG I WAS.

00:21:11.588 --> 00:21:12.723
( Eugeo gasps )

00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:17.461
AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT!

00:21:17.528 --> 00:21:19.796
Kirito: HIS MENTOR IS ALICE?

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.798
Knight: THAT SAID,
YOU'LL BE RETURNING

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:23.900
TO YOUR GLOOMY PRISON SHORTLY

00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:27.338
AFTER I ADMINISTER PUNISHMENT
FOR YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.942
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED,
SO PREPARE YOURSELVES.

00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:34.145
Kirito: WELL,
HERE'S A WARNING FOR YOU, THEN.

00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:36.813
IF YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA
GO BACK THERE WITHOUT A FIGHT,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.482
‐ YOU'RE CRAZY.
‐ ( Knight gasps )

00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:40.651
♪♪

00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:43.420
( laughs )

00:21:43.487 --> 00:21:45.156
SUCH NERVE!

00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:48.359
IN HONOR OF YOUR BRAVADO,
I SHALL INTRODUCE MYSELF.

00:21:52.063 --> 00:21:55.932
I AM THE INTEGRITY KNIGHT
ELDRIE SYNTHESIS THIRTY‐ONE.

00:21:55.999 --> 00:21:58.902
I DO NOT HAVE A TERRITORY
TO MY NAME YET,

00:21:58.969 --> 00:22:02.039
AS I WAS FRESHLY SUMMONED
ONLY A MONTH AGO.

00:22:03.374 --> 00:22:06.243
I DO HOPE THAT FACT
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU.
