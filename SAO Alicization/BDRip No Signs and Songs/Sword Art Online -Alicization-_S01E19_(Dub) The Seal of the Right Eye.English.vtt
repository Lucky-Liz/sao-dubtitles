THEY COULD ALL
RISE UP AGAINST HER.

00:06:10.757 --> 00:06:14.694

SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THE WEAK,

AND COMMONERS

00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:51.497

YOU GUYS HAVE GOT STASHED
HERE IN THE TOWER.

BUILD AN ARMY IN A YEAR OR SO.

00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:12.619
IT CAN'T HAPPEN IF THE PONTIFEX
IS STILL IN CHARGE.
