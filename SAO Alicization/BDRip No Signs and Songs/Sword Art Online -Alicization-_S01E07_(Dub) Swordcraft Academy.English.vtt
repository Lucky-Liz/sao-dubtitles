AFTER BEING STUCK HERE
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS,

00:06:11.851 --> 00:06:13.320
I LEARNED THAT, IN THIS WORLD,

00:06:13.386 --> 00:06:17.157
YOUR TRUE POWER WASN'T
JUST EXPRESSED IN NUMBERS.

00:06:18.258 --> 00:06:21.028
ONLY THREE STATS
SHOW UP IN YOUR WINDOW,

00:06:21.094 --> 00:06:23.963
YOUR LIFE,
YOUR OBJECT CONTROL AUTHORITY,

00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:26.066
AND YOUR
SYSTEM CONTROL AUTHORITY.

00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:30.103
IF YOUR OBJECT CONTROL
AUTHORITY'S A LOW NUMBER,

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.473
YOU CAN BARELY EVEN HOLD
A HIGHER‐CLASS WEAPON.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.443
BUT IF YOUR STAT'S WAY BIGGER
THAN THE WEAPON'S,

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.078
IT FEELS CRAZY LIGHT.

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:41.348
YOUR SYSTEM CONTROL
AUTHORITY STAT

00:06:41.414 --> 00:06:44.451
TELLS YOU WHAT KIND
OF SACRED ARTS YOU CAN USE.

00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:47.687
IF YOU'RE LOW‐LEVEL,
YOU CAN ONLY USE SIMPLE SPELLS.

00:06:47.754 --> 00:06:49.356
BUT IF YOU LEVEL UP,

00:06:49.422 --> 00:06:52.625
YOU GET ACCESS
TO MORE SOPHISTICATED ONES.

00:06:54.994 --> 00:06:57.230
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
IN GAMES, TOO,

00:06:57.297 --> 00:07:00.700
BUT THERE'S AN EXTRA FEATURE
HERE THAT AFFECTS YOUR STATS.

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:03.603
IT'S SOMETHING S.A.O.
AND A.L.O. DIDN'T HAVE.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.007
SOMETIMES, THE STRENGTH
OF A MENTAL IMAGE YOU CREATE

00:07:07.074 --> 00:07:08.608
CAN INFLUENCE YOUR STATS.

00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:12.212
IF A PERSON HAS THE CONFIDENCE
OR WILL TO WIN,

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:15.948
THEIR POWER CAN BE AMPLIFIED
MANY TIMES OVER.

00:07:16.016 --> 00:07:19.086
THAT'S WHAT MAKES LIENA
SO POWERFUL.

00:07:19.152 --> 00:07:22.289
SHE'S CONFIDENT,
'CAUSE EVER SINCE SHE WAS A KID,

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:24.857
SHE HAD THE BEST TRAINING
IN SWORDSMANSHIP.

00:07:24.924 --> 00:07:29.329
SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE YOURSELF
TO BE MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYONE,

00:18:14.445 --> 00:18:16.713
Eugeo: OKAY.
JUST DON'T BE LATE FOR DINNER!

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.814
Kirito: I WON'T!

00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:20.551
‐ ( grunts )
‐ ( sword swings )

00:18:22.553 --> 00:18:24.488
( grunting )

00:18:28.158 --> 00:18:31.562
THIS WORLD'S NO GAME,
BUT IT'S GOT SWORD SKILLS.

00:18:31.628 --> 00:18:36.199
I CAN ONLY DO TWO‐HIT COMBOS
WITH MY PRACTICE SWORD.

00:18:36.266 --> 00:18:38.602
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS CAN DO.

00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:40.404
( yells )

00:18:45.976 --> 00:18:47.511
Volo: HUH.

00:18:49.145 --> 00:18:50.246
Kirito: THIS IS GREAT!

00:18:50.314 --> 00:18:52.749
I CAN KEEP MY PROMISE
TO LIENA NOW!

00:18:52.816 --> 00:18:55.151
NO, WAIT.
HOW 'BOUT A FIVE‐PARTER?

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:57.588
THE BLUE ROSE SWORD
COULDN'T DO ONE,

00:18:57.654 --> 00:18:59.022
BUT MAYBE THIS CAN.

00:19:03.794 --> 00:19:05.261
( yells )

00:19:05.329 --> 00:19:08.131
( groans )

00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:12.403
Volo: HMPH.

00:19:12.469 --> 00:19:14.137
( Kirito groans )

00:19:14.204 --> 00:19:15.572
GUESS IT CAN'T.

00:19:15.639 --> 00:19:17.341
‐ ( footsteps )
‐ OH?

00:19:22.646 --> 00:19:24.481
FIRST SEAT LEVANTEIN!

00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:26.850
( gasps )

00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:30.086
I‐I'M SORRY,
ELITE DISCIPLE LEVANTEIN.

00:19:30.153 --> 00:19:33.056
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GET DIRT
ON YOUR UNIFORM!

00:19:33.123 --> 00:19:34.658
Volo: I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE.

00:19:34.725 --> 00:19:37.060
YOU'RE ELITE DISCIPLE
SERLUT'S PAGE.

00:19:37.127 --> 00:19:38.261
Kirito: YES, SIR,

00:19:38.329 --> 00:19:40.230
‐ PRIMARY TRAINEE KIRITO.
‐ Volo: RIGHT.

00:19:40.296 --> 00:19:43.800
PRACTICING THE SWORD
IS FORBIDDEN ON A DAY OF REST.

00:19:43.867 --> 00:19:46.069
Kirito: I, UM‐‐I WASN'T.

00:19:46.136 --> 00:19:47.938
THIS ISN'T PRACTICE, SIR.

00:19:48.004 --> 00:19:51.141
UM, I WAS JUST TRYING OUT
MY NEW SWORD.

00:19:51.207 --> 00:19:52.976
I COULDN'T WAIT 'TIL TOMORROW.

00:19:53.043 --> 00:19:56.413
Volo: YOUR TEST SWINGS WERE‐‐
HOW SHALL I SAY?

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.115
‐ ENTHUSIASTIC.
‐ ( Kirito stammers )

00:19:59.182 --> 00:20:02.319
Volo: YOU AND I
ARE SIMILAR THAT WAY.

00:20:02.386 --> 00:20:06.056
WE BOTH SEARCH FOR A REASON
TO WIELD A SWORD,

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.325
EVEN ON A DAY OF REST,

00:20:08.392 --> 00:20:10.394
YEARNING TO SCRATCH THAT ITCH.

00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:12.496
‐ Kirito: YOU, TOO?
‐ Volo: YES,

00:20:12.563 --> 00:20:15.399
SO I SHALL OVERLOOK
THAT TRANSGRESSION.

00:20:15.466 --> 00:20:16.767
Kirito:
YOU'RE VERY GENEROUS, SIR.

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:18.001
THANK YOU FOR‐‐

00:20:18.068 --> 00:20:20.136
Volo: DO NOT THANK ME YET,
TRAINEE KIRITO.

00:20:20.203 --> 00:20:21.505
Kirito: UH, PARDON?

00:20:21.572 --> 00:20:25.676
Volo: I DID NOT SAY
I WOULD FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS.

00:20:25.742 --> 00:20:27.611
( overlapping chatter )

00:20:32.883 --> 00:20:34.551
Kirito: NEWS TRAVELS FAST.

00:20:34.618 --> 00:20:35.552
( door closes )

00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:37.020
Eugeo: KIRITO!

00:20:37.087 --> 00:20:39.323
WHAT'D YOU DO THIS TIME?

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.957
Kirito: NOTHIN'. ( chuckles )

00:20:41.024 --> 00:20:43.727
Eugeo: OH, WELL.
IT WAS A GOOD RUN.

00:20:43.794 --> 00:20:47.030
YOU SURVIVED A WHOLE YEAR HERE
WITHOUT GETTING INTO TROUBLE.

00:20:47.097 --> 00:20:49.132
Kirito: NEW RECORD, PARTNER!

00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:52.769
Liena: LORD LEVANTEIN,
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:54.838
Volo: JUST A MINOR INFRACTION.

00:20:54.905 --> 00:20:57.408
YOUR PAGE
WAS DISRESPECTFUL TO ME,

00:20:57.474 --> 00:21:00.243
NOTHING THAT DEMANDS
SERIOUS PUNISHMENT, MIND YOU,

00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:03.179
SO WE SHALL SETTLE IT
BY SPARRING WITH REAL SWORDS.

00:21:03.246 --> 00:21:04.815
Liena: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:21:04.881 --> 00:21:08.018
Kirito: YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME, MA'AM. REALLY.

00:21:08.084 --> 00:21:09.786
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.788
IN FACT, I SORTA FEEL HONORED

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.458
TO GET THE CHANCE TO SPAR
WITH THE FIRST SEAT HERE.

00:21:14.525 --> 00:21:15.492
Liena: KIRITO...

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:17.328
HAVE YOU DISCUSSED
THE RULES WITH HIM YET?

00:21:17.394 --> 00:21:20.597
Kirito: NO, BUT SINCE
WE'RE USING REAL SWORDS,

00:21:20.664 --> 00:21:21.665
ISN'T IT STOP‐SHORT?

00:21:21.732 --> 00:21:23.900
Volo: I FORGOT
TO MENTION SOMETHING EARLIER.

00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:27.371
I DO NOT ENGAGE
IN SHORT‐STOP DUELS.

00:21:27.438 --> 00:21:31.375
FOR ALL MY PERSONAL MATCHES,
I PREFER TO FIGHT FIRST‐STRIKE.

00:21:31.442 --> 00:21:33.977
Liena: HE'S NEVER FOUGHT
A MATCH WITH REAL SWORDS!

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.278
BESIDES, YOU NEED HIS CONSENT!

00:21:35.346 --> 00:21:37.548
Volo: OF COURSE. MINE, TOO.

00:21:37.614 --> 00:21:40.451
THIS CANNOT PROCEED
UNLESS WE BOTH AGREE.

00:21:40.517 --> 00:21:44.488
AND IF HE DOES NOT,
THE MATCH WILL BE STOP‐SHORT.

00:21:44.555 --> 00:21:47.257
WELL, TRAINEE KIRITO,
DO YOU AGREE?

00:21:47.324 --> 00:21:49.326
Liena: DON'T DO IT, KIRITO.

00:21:49.393 --> 00:21:51.562
VOLO'S STRONG. HE WILL HURT YOU.

00:21:51.628 --> 00:21:56.032
Kirito: I THINK I'LL LET YOU
DECIDE IT, LORD LEVANTEIN.

00:21:56.099 --> 00:21:58.101
I'M THE ONE
BEING PUNISHED, AFTER ALL.

00:21:58.168 --> 00:21:59.703
