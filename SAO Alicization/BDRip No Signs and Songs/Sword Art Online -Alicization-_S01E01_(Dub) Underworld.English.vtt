Asuna: WELL, BYE.

00:30:15.922 --> 00:30:18.725
‐ Sinon: NO, WAIT. ONE SEC.
‐ Asuna: WHAT'S UP?

00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:21.094
Sinon: I WAS HOPING YOU GUYS
COULD HELP ME WITH SOMETHING.

00:30:21.161 --> 00:30:23.296
Asuna: THAT SQUAD OF P.K.ers?

00:30:23.363 --> 00:30:26.833
Sinon: NO,
IT'S SOMETHING ELSE, ACTUALLY.

00:30:28.835 --> 00:30:32.805
IF YOU AND KIRITO HAVE TIME,
COULD WE MEET I.R.L. TOMORROW?

00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:34.474
Asuna: I THINK SO.

00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:36.576
YEAH, I'M FREE IN THE EVENING.

00:30:36.643 --> 00:30:38.211
DO YOU WANT TO MEET AT AGIL'S?

00:30:38.278 --> 00:30:39.379
Sinon: SURE.

00:30:39.446 --> 00:30:41.914
OH, I'LL ALSO
EMAIL YOU THE PLAN

00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:44.284
SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

00:30:44.351 --> 00:30:46.353
Asuna: SOUNDS GOOD.

00:30:49.022 --> 00:30:50.423
( Kirito gasps )

00:30:52.459 --> 00:30:55.162
Shino: YOU'RE SO THIN.
ARE YOU EATING?

00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:57.464
Kazuto: WHAT ARE YOU, MY MOM?

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:01.268
ANYWAY, WHAT IS IT
YOU WANTED TO ASK ME?

00:31:01.334 --> 00:31:02.902
IS IT ABOUT B.o.B.?

00:31:02.969 --> 00:31:04.071
Shino: MM‐HMM.

00:31:04.137 --> 00:31:06.973
THERE'S A PLAYER
CALLING HIMSELF SUBTILIZER,

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.475
WHO WON B.o.B. FOUR.

00:31:08.541 --> 00:31:11.944
HE'S THE SAME GUY
WHO WON THE FIRST B.o.B.

00:31:12.012 --> 00:31:13.013
Kazuto: HUH.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.382
Shino: WHEN WE FOUND OUT
HE WAS IN FOUR,

00:31:15.448 --> 00:31:18.651
EVERYONE GOT EXCITED, 'CAUSE
HE'S LIKE A LEGEND, YOU KNOW?

00:31:18.718 --> 00:31:20.987
Kazuto: YEAH. WE ALL
WATCHED THE LIVE FEED.

00:31:21.054 --> 00:31:24.024
CAN'T BELIEVE HE STARTED
WITH JUST HIS BARE HANDS.

00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:26.626
HE FOUGHT WITH A CONFIDANT,
STEALTHY STYLE,

00:31:26.693 --> 00:31:28.195
LIKE THAT TEAM
FROM THE OTHER DAY.

00:31:28.261 --> 00:31:30.763
Shino: THEY DID HAVE
THE SAME VIBE, DIDN'T THEY?

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:35.368
WELL, EXCEPT SUBTILIZER'S ON
A WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL THAN THEM.

00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:36.636
( sighs )

00:31:36.703 --> 00:31:38.738
HE KILLED ME SO FAST.

00:31:38.805 --> 00:31:40.840
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO AIM.

00:31:40.907 --> 00:31:43.576
THAT'S HOW IT WAS
FOR EVERYONE IN THE TOURNEY.

00:31:43.643 --> 00:31:46.313
IT'S LIKE HE KNEW OUR MOVES
BEFORE WE DID.

00:31:46.379 --> 00:31:47.714
Kazuto: NO WAY. REALLY?

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.816
BUT YOU'RE ALL VETS AT B.o.B.

00:31:49.882 --> 00:31:53.286
HOW COULD HE ANTICIPATE
EVERYONE'S MOVES LIKE THAT?

00:31:53.353 --> 00:31:54.554
Shino: I SUPPOSE, AS VETS,

00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:56.723
THERE'S A PREDICTABILITY
TO HOW WE PLAY.

00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:59.892
WE TEND TO USE THE SAME MOVES,
'CAUSE THEY WORK.

00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:02.829
WHICH BRINGS ME
TO WHY YOU'RE HERE.

00:32:02.895 --> 00:32:03.930
( Kazuto sighs )

00:32:03.996 --> 00:32:05.698
Shino: I WAS THINKING
THAT A PLAYER

00:32:05.765 --> 00:32:07.667
WITH A MORE CHAOTIC
FIGHTING STYLE

00:32:07.734 --> 00:32:10.770
MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
AT OUTMANEUVERING SUBTILIZER.

00:32:10.837 --> 00:32:13.540
ANYWAY, THE POINT
IS THE NEXT B.o.B.'S

00:32:13.606 --> 00:32:15.442
GONNA BE HAPPENING
AT THE END OF THE YEAR,

00:32:15.508 --> 00:32:17.577
AND I'D LIKE YOU
TO SIGN UP FOR IT.

00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:19.046
Kazuto: HUH? UH...

00:32:19.112 --> 00:32:21.548
Shino: THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA LET MYSELF LOSE

00:32:21.614 --> 00:32:24.651
TO THE SAME GUY AGAIN.
HE'S GOING DOWN.

00:32:25.752 --> 00:32:28.155
Kazuto: LOOKS LIKE
YOU MADE SOME PROGRESS.

00:32:28.221 --> 00:32:30.457
Shino: O‐OH, YEAH.

00:32:30.523 --> 00:32:33.060
I STILL GET THE SHAKES
EVERY NOW AND THEN,

00:32:33.126 --> 00:32:34.861
BUT I'M GETTING BETTER.

00:32:35.762 --> 00:32:37.164
Kazuto: AND YOUR FRIEND,

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.565
IS HE DOING ANY BETTER?

00:32:38.631 --> 00:32:39.566
( Shino sighs )

00:32:39.632 --> 00:32:41.834
YOU MEAN SHINKAWA.

00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:44.937
YEAH, HE'S MAKING PROGRESS.

00:32:45.005 --> 00:32:48.741
I'LL PROBABLY GO VISIT HIM
AGAIN IN A COUPLE DAYS.

00:32:48.808 --> 00:32:50.443
Kazuto: THAT'S GOOD.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.245
WELL, LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

00:32:52.312 --> 00:32:55.648
HE'S FINALLY GETTING THE HELP
HE NEEDS. DEATH GUN'S OVER.

00:32:55.715 --> 00:32:57.450
Shino: NO, IT ISN'T.

00:32:57.517 --> 00:32:59.486
HIS PARTNER'S
STILL OUT THERE, REMEMBER?

00:32:59.552 --> 00:33:02.422
Kazuto: YEAH, BUT KIKUOKA SAID

00:33:02.489 --> 00:33:04.157
THEY'LL CATCH UP WITH HIM
SOON ENOUGH.

00:33:04.224 --> 00:33:05.992
Shino: YEAH, I HOPE SO.

00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:07.194
‐ ( entry bell rings )
‐ ( Asuna sighs )

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.428
SORRY I'M LATE!

00:33:08.495 --> 00:33:10.397
HEY THERE, SHINONON!

00:33:10.463 --> 00:33:11.664
Kazuto: WHAT'D YOU
JUST CALL HER?

00:33:11.731 --> 00:33:13.966
Shino: HEY, ASUNA.
RIGHT ON TIME.

00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:17.737
Asuna: I READ YOUR EMAIL
ABOUT B.o.B. FIVE. I'M IN.

00:33:17.804 --> 00:33:20.007
Kazuto: WAIT.
YOU ASKED HER TO HELP, TOO?

00:33:20.073 --> 00:33:22.175
Shino: YUP. I FIGURED
IF IT WERE JUST YOU,

00:33:22.242 --> 00:33:24.511
THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU'D GET TOO AGGRO.

00:33:24.577 --> 00:33:27.080
EVEN GOOD DOGS
NEED A LEASH, RIGHT?

00:33:27.147 --> 00:33:28.081
Kazuto: DANG.

00:33:28.148 --> 00:33:30.250
Asuna: HEY, KIRITO.

00:33:30.317 --> 00:33:33.386
YOU'RE SO THIN. ARE YOU EATING?

00:33:33.453 --> 00:33:34.687
Kazuto: YEAH, I AM.

00:33:34.754 --> 00:33:36.056
Shino: HAH! SEE?

00:33:36.123 --> 00:33:38.091
SHE CAN EVEN TELL
SOMETHING'S UP.

00:33:38.158 --> 00:33:40.160
Asuna: IT'S THAT PART‐TIME JOB,
ISN'T IT?

00:33:40.227 --> 00:33:41.628
HONESTLY.

00:33:41.694 --> 00:33:42.862
Kazuto: UH...

00:33:42.929 --> 00:33:46.133
Asuna: PHYSICALLY,
YOU'RE FINE, SO FAR.

00:33:46.199 --> 00:33:48.201
Shino: WAIT. YOU CAN TELL?

00:33:48.268 --> 00:33:49.236
EH?

00:33:49.302 --> 00:33:51.071
WHAT'S THAT?

00:33:51.138 --> 00:33:53.606
Kazuto: IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

00:33:53.673 --> 00:33:57.010
Shino: HUH?! YOU MEAN
SHE CAN TRACK YOUR VITALS?!

00:33:57.077 --> 00:33:58.311
Asuna: NEAT, HUH?

00:33:58.378 --> 00:33:59.546
Shino: YEAH, I GUESS,

00:33:59.612 --> 00:34:01.381
BUT, LIKE, HOW'S IT WORK?

00:34:01.448 --> 00:34:02.782
Kazuto: A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

00:34:02.849 --> 00:34:06.186
I HAD THIS MINIATURE SENSOR
IMPLANTED IN MY CHEST.

00:34:06.253 --> 00:34:08.788
IT SENDS MY HEART RATE,
BODY TEMPERATURE,

00:34:08.855 --> 00:34:11.158
AND OTHER STUFF OVER THE NET
TO ASUNA'S SMARTPHONE.

00:34:11.224 --> 00:34:13.960
Shino: WHAT?!
WH‐WHY WOULD YOU WANNA DO‐‐

00:34:14.027 --> 00:34:17.097
OH, I GET IT.
IT'S AN ANTI‐CHEATING SYSTEM.

00:34:17.164 --> 00:34:18.798
‐ Kazuto: NO! NOT EVEN!
‐ Asuna: NO! NOT EVEN!

00:34:18.865 --> 00:34:21.468
Kazuto: WHEN I STARTED
THIS PART‐TIME JOB,

00:34:21.534 --> 00:34:23.736
THEY THOUGHT
IT'D BE GOOD TO GET IT.

00:34:23.803 --> 00:34:26.106
I HAVE TO WEAR ELECTRODES,
AND STICKING 'EM ON

00:34:26.173 --> 00:34:28.208
AND PULLING 'EM OFF'S
KIND OF A HASSLE.

00:34:28.275 --> 00:34:33.013
USING IT LIKE THIS WAS HER IDEA,
SO I MADE A LITTLE APP FOR IT.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.116
Asuna: YEAH, SOMETHING
ABOUT LOOKING AT IT'S
KIND OF SOOTHING,

00:34:36.183 --> 00:34:40.087
KNOWING THAT'S KIRITO'S HEART
BEATING. ( sighs )

00:34:40.153 --> 00:34:42.489
I GET ALL WOOZY,
AND MY HEAD STARTS TO SPIN.

00:34:42.555 --> 00:34:43.856
( Kazuto sighs, chuckles )

00:34:43.923 --> 00:34:47.594
Shino: UH, THAT'S BOTH CUTE
AND KINDA CREEPY.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.962
A‐ANYWAY, WITH YOU ON MY SIDE,

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.898
I'LL HAVE A MACHINE GUN
IN MY PILLBOX.

00:34:51.964 --> 00:34:54.734
YOU'RE EXACTLY THE EDGE I NEED.

00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:57.104
Asuna: I'M HAPPY TO HELP
ANY WAY I CAN.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:58.071
( Kazuto chuckles )

00:34:58.138 --> 00:34:59.872
‐ Shino: NOW, THEN...
‐ Kirito: WHAT?

00:34:59.939 --> 00:35:01.041
Shino: I WANNA HEAR SOME MORE

00:35:01.108 --> 00:35:03.410
ABOUT THIS SKETCHY
NEW JOB OF YOURS.

00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:04.844
LET ME GUESS.

00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:08.648
YOU'RE ALPHA TESTING
A NEW VRMMO GAME, RIGHT?

00:35:08.715 --> 00:35:11.018
Kazuto: ACTUALLY,
IT'S NOT A GAME.

00:35:11.084 --> 00:35:13.720
IT'S A BRAIN‐MACHINE INTERFACE

00:35:13.786 --> 00:35:15.988
DESIGNED FOR THIS
BRAND‐NEW FULL‐DIVE SYSTEM.

00:35:16.056 --> 00:35:19.092
RATH DEVELOPED IT.
THEY'RE NEW.

00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:21.394
Shino: WHAT THE HECK
KIND OF A NAME IS "RATH"?

00:35:21.461 --> 00:35:23.863
Asuna: IT'S THE NAME
OF AN IMAGINARY CREATURE.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:26.266
I REMEMBER IT FROM THE BOOK
"THROUGH THE LOOKING‐GLASS."

00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:29.802
SOME CHARACTERS SAID IT WAS
A PIG, AND OTHERS, A TURTLE.

00:35:29.869 --> 00:35:31.271
Shino: SO ARE THEY RELEASING

00:35:31.338 --> 00:35:34.041
SOME NEXT‐GEN FULL‐DIVE RIG
FOR GAMING?

00:35:34.107 --> 00:35:37.144
Kazuto: I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.012
THIS THING'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT

00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:41.214
COMPARED TO THE FULL‐DIVE TECH
THAT'S OUT NOW.

00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:45.152
Shino: OH. SO WHAT'S
THE IN‐GAME WORLD LIKE?

00:35:46.219 --> 00:35:49.189
‐ Kazuto: I HAVE NO IDEA.
‐ Shino: HUH?

00:35:49.256 --> 00:35:51.324
Kazuto: IT'S HOW THEY
KEEP THINGS CONFIDENTIAL.

00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:55.295
THE MEMORIES I MAKE USING
THEIR RIG IN THE VR WORLD,

00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:58.131
THEY DON'T STICK WITH ME
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:35:58.198 --> 00:36:00.900
WHATEVER I SAW DURING THE TESTS,
WHATEVER I DID,

00:36:00.967 --> 00:36:03.836
I FORGET ALL OF IT
AFTER I LOG OUT.

00:36:03.903 --> 00:36:05.305
‐ Shino: UH, HUH?!
‐ ( Asuna gasps )

00:36:05.372 --> 00:36:07.840
Shino: YOU CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING AT ALL?

00:36:07.907 --> 00:36:11.044
OH, MY GOD.
IS IT ANOTHER AUGMA?

00:36:11.111 --> 00:36:15.082
Kazuto: UH, N‐NO.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!

00:36:15.148 --> 00:36:18.251
THIS RIG DOESN'T PUT STRESS ON
YOUR BRAIN LIKE THE AUGMA DID.

00:36:18.318 --> 00:36:20.320
I DIDN'T LOSE MY MEMORIES
OR ANYTHING.

00:36:20.387 --> 00:36:22.789
I JUST CAN'T ACCESS THEM
FROM MY FLUCTLIGHT.

00:36:22.855 --> 00:36:25.158
‐ Shino: UH...
‐ Asuna: A FLUCT WHAT?

00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:28.628
Kazuto: THIS IS GONNA
TAKE SOME TIME TO EXPLAIN.

00:36:28.695 --> 00:36:30.130
FIRST OFF,

00:36:30.197 --> 00:36:34.301
THE RIG I'M TESTING'S
CALLED THE SOUL TRANSLATOR.

00:36:35.904 --> 00:36:38.540
WHERE IN YOUR BODY
DO YOU THINK YOUR SOUL IS?

00:36:38.607 --> 00:36:39.841
Asuna: SERIOUSLY?

00:36:39.908 --> 00:36:42.111
Shino: I DON'T KNOW.
IN THE BRAIN?

00:36:42.177 --> 00:36:44.113
Kazuto: IF YOU ZOOM IN
TO THE BRAIN,

00:36:44.179 --> 00:36:46.181
YOU'LL SEE
IT'S MADE UP OF CELLS.

00:36:46.248 --> 00:36:50.552
SO WHERE IN ALL THOSE CELLS
DO YOU THINK THE SOUL IS?

00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:51.920
Shino: I‐I DON'T KNOW.

00:36:51.986 --> 00:36:53.222
Kazuto: ZOOM IN TO A BRAIN CELL,

00:36:53.288 --> 00:36:55.124
AND YOU'LL SEE
THAT IT HAS THINGS IN IT

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.958
THAT SUPPORT
THE CELL'S STRUCTURE.

00:36:57.026 --> 00:36:59.128
THEY'RE CALLED MICROTUBULES.

00:36:59.194 --> 00:36:59.928
Shino: OKAY.

00:36:59.994 --> 00:37:01.463
Kazuto: LIKE THE NAME IMPLIES,

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:04.733
THEY'RE LIKE HOLLOW PIPES,
BUT THEY'RE NOT EMPTY.

00:37:04.799 --> 00:37:07.001
THEY GOT SOMETHING
SEALED INSIDE.

00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:09.771
Shino: SO WHAT
DO THEY HAVE INSIDE?

00:37:09.838 --> 00:37:11.540
Kazuto: LIGHT.

00:37:11.606 --> 00:37:15.144
THAT'S IT, FLUCTUATING LIGHT.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.746
IT'S THE BUILDING BLOCK
OF THE HUMAN SOUL,

00:37:17.812 --> 00:37:18.980
ACCORDING TO RATH.

00:37:19.048 --> 00:37:21.116
Asuna: SO LET ME SEE
IF I UNDERSTAND THIS.

00:37:21.183 --> 00:37:25.387
THEY'RE SAYING THIS LIGHT
IN BRAIN CELLS, THAT'S THE SOUL?

00:37:25.454 --> 00:37:26.755
Kazuto: YEAH.

00:37:26.821 --> 00:37:29.091
THEY DON'T CALL IT
A SOUL AT RATH, THOUGH.

00:37:29.158 --> 00:37:31.126
THEY DECIDED TO GO
WITH A COMBINATION

00:37:31.193 --> 00:37:33.895
OF THE WORDS "FLUCTUATING"
AND "LIGHT,"

00:37:33.962 --> 00:37:35.864
"FLUCTLIGHT" FOR SHORT.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:36.931
Shino: HUH.

00:37:36.998 --> 00:37:38.367
Asuna: THEN THE SOUL TRANSLATOR

00:37:38.433 --> 00:37:40.435
DOESN'T JUST READ
A PERSON'S BRAIN.

00:37:40.502 --> 00:37:41.836
IT READS THEIR FLUCTLIGHT.

00:37:41.903 --> 00:37:44.806
WHICH MEANS IT CAN
ALSO IMPRINT ON THEM.

00:37:44.873 --> 00:37:46.008
Shino: IMPRINT?

00:37:46.075 --> 00:37:47.442
Asuna: LIKE THE AMUSPHERE.

00:37:47.509 --> 00:37:50.479
THAT RIG LETS YOU EXPERIENCE
VR BY SENDING IMAGES,

00:37:50.545 --> 00:37:53.815
SOUNDS, AND OTHER SENSORY
INFORMATION TO YOUR BRAIN.

00:37:53.882 --> 00:37:56.285
WITH THIS RIG,
SINCE IT'S NEXT‐GEN AND ALL,

00:37:56.351 --> 00:37:59.188
IT WOULD WORK THE SAME WAY,
BUT ON YOUR SOUL, RIGHT?

00:37:59.254 --> 00:38:01.223
Kazuto: YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.658
THE NAME
PRETTY MUCH SAYS IT ALL.

00:38:03.725 --> 00:38:06.061
THE SOUL TRANSLATOR, OR S.T.L.,

00:38:06.128 --> 00:38:08.397
WRITES SHORT‐TERM MEMORIES
ONTO YOUR FLUCTLIGHT

00:38:08.463 --> 00:38:11.433
OF THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS
IT WANTS YOU TO EXPERIENCE.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.204
MNEMONIC VISUAL DATA
IS WHAT IT'S CALLED.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:19.574
I REMEMBER THE TEST DIVES I TOOK
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE JOB.

00:38:19.641 --> 00:38:20.909
( note vibrates )

00:38:20.975 --> 00:38:22.544
THOSE DIVES WERE DIFFERENT.

00:38:22.611 --> 00:38:24.379
I WAS BLOWN AWAY.

00:38:24.446 --> 00:38:27.516
IT'S NOTHING LIKE
WHAT THE AMUSPHERE CREATES.

00:38:27.582 --> 00:38:30.052
EVERYTHING WAS SO REAL,

00:38:30.119 --> 00:38:33.022
I COULDN'T TELL IT WAS
A VIRTUAL WORLD AT FIRST.

00:38:33.088 --> 00:38:35.890
Asuna: I DON'T KNOW.
THIS SCARES ME.

00:38:35.957 --> 00:38:39.294
I MEAN, IS IT SAFE?

00:38:39.361 --> 00:38:42.097
MR. KIKUOKA OFFERED YOU THE JOB,
AND THAT'S GREAT,

00:38:42.164 --> 00:38:44.266
BUT WHO KNOWS
WHAT HIS MOTIVES ARE?

00:38:44.333 --> 00:38:45.367
( Kirito sighs )

00:38:45.434 --> 00:38:46.568
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,

00:38:46.635 --> 00:38:49.604
BUT I DON'T LET MY GUARD DOWN
AROUND HIM EVER.

00:38:49.671 --> 00:38:52.607
THE THING IS I WANNA KNOW.

00:38:52.674 --> 00:38:56.578
I HAVE TO DO THIS TO SEE
WHERE FULL‐DIVE'S HEADING.

00:38:56.645 --> 00:39:00.415
I KNOW IT'S RISKY,
BUT THE S.T.L.'S SPECIAL.

00:39:00.482 --> 00:39:04.853
SURE TERMS LIKE "MNEMONIC"
AND "FLUCTLIGHT" SOUND CREEPY,

00:39:04.919 --> 00:39:06.155
BUT I CONNECT WITH IT.

00:39:06.221 --> 00:39:08.157
WAY MORE THAN THE AMUSPHERE.

00:39:08.223 --> 00:39:10.825
IT'S LIKE A WAKING DREAM
WHEN I'M IN IT.

00:39:10.892 --> 00:39:12.127
Asuna: HOW SO?

00:39:12.194 --> 00:39:14.296
Kazuto: YOU KNOW
HOW YOU SOMETIMES HAVE DREAMS

00:39:14.363 --> 00:39:16.965
THAT SEEM LONG,
THE KIND WHERE YOU WAKE UP

00:39:17.032 --> 00:39:19.368
AND YOU'D SWEAR THAT DREAM
WENT ON FOR HOURS,

00:39:19.434 --> 00:39:22.004
ESPECIALLY IF IT
WAS A NIGHTMARE?

00:39:22.071 --> 00:39:23.838
THE TRUTH IS, THAT DREAM

00:39:23.905 --> 00:39:25.674
PROBABLY ONLY LASTED
A FEW MINUTES.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.711
YOU GET THAT SAME PHENOMENA
IF YOU DIVE WITH THE S.T.L.

00:39:29.778 --> 00:39:30.845
Shino: SERIOUSLY?

00:39:30.912 --> 00:39:32.581
Kazuto: IT'S JUST LIKE A DREAM

00:39:32.647 --> 00:39:35.417
THAT FELT LIKE HOURS,
BUT WAS ONLY A FEW MINUTES.

00:39:35.484 --> 00:39:39.621
YOUR TIME DIVING WITH THE S.T.L.
IS WAY LONGER THAN YOUR DIVE.

00:39:39.688 --> 00:39:41.190
( Sinon gasps )

00:39:41.256 --> 00:39:43.392
Kazuto: THAT'S THE MAIN FEATURE
OF THE S.T.L.

00:39:43.458 --> 00:39:46.361
RATH CALLS IT
FLUCTLIGHT ACCELERATION,

00:39:46.428 --> 00:39:49.564
OR F.L.A. FOR SHORT.

00:39:49.631 --> 00:39:50.765
Shino: WHOA.

00:39:50.832 --> 00:39:52.567
Asuna: I'M SO CONFUSED.

00:39:52.634 --> 00:39:53.768
Shino: MY HEAD'S SPINNING.

00:39:53.835 --> 00:39:56.405
YOU WERE DIVING
FOR THREE WHOLE DAYS,

00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:59.008
SO HOW MUCH TIME
WAS THAT IN VR?

00:39:59.074 --> 00:40:00.442
Kazuto: MM, I'M NOT SURE.

00:40:00.509 --> 00:40:03.078
IT COULD HAVE BEEN TEN DAYS
OR A MONTH.

00:40:03.145 --> 00:40:05.214
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW LONG.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.383
WHEN I ASKED HOW LONG,
THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME,

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.153
BUT THEY DID TELL ME
THE CODE NAME OF THE TEST WORLD.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.188
Shino: REALLY? WHAT IS IT?

00:40:13.255 --> 00:40:14.623
Kazuto: THE UNDERWORLD.

00:40:14.689 --> 00:40:17.159
Shino: SO IT'S LIKE
AN UNDERGROUND WORLD?

00:40:17.226 --> 00:40:18.360
Asuna: IT'S A REFERENCE.

00:40:18.427 --> 00:40:20.595
IT HAS TO DO WITH "ALICE,"
SAME AS RATH.

00:40:20.662 --> 00:40:24.066
"ALICE IN WONDERLAND"
WAS THE TITLE THE BOOK
WAS PUBLISHED UNDER,

00:40:24.133 --> 00:40:26.901
BUT IT HAD A DIFFERENT TITLE
WHEN IT WAS BEING WRITTEN.

00:40:26.968 --> 00:40:29.071
ORIGINALLY IT WAS CALLED

00:40:29.138 --> 00:40:31.373
"ALICE'S ADVENTURES
UNDER GROUND."

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.441
( Kirito sighs )

00:40:32.507 --> 00:40:34.276
Shino: YOU OKAY?

00:40:34.343 --> 00:40:36.445
Kazuto: WHEN I HEARD
THE NAME "ALICE,"

00:40:36.511 --> 00:40:39.214
IT FELT LIKE I WAS
ABOUT TO REMEMBER SOMETHING.

00:40:39.281 --> 00:40:41.216
Shino: SOMETHING ABOUT THE TEST?

00:40:41.283 --> 00:40:42.584
Kazuto: I'M NOT SURE.

00:40:42.651 --> 00:40:45.954
IT FEELS LIKE
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO DO.

00:40:46.021 --> 00:40:48.523
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.160
( Asuna sighs )

00:40:52.027 --> 00:40:52.961
Shino: THANKS, AGIL.

00:40:53.028 --> 00:40:54.096
SEE YOU LATER!

00:40:54.163 --> 00:40:56.265
‐ Andrew: BYE, GUYS!
‐ ( entry bell rings )

00:41:01.603 --> 00:41:04.406
Shino: I'LL KEEP YOU GUYS
UP TO DATE ABOUT B.o.B.

00:41:04.473 --> 00:41:06.908
THANKS AGAIN
FOR MEETING UP WITH ME TODAY.

00:41:06.975 --> 00:41:08.943
Asuna: SURE!
SEE YOU LATER, SHINONON!

00:41:09.011 --> 00:41:10.312
Shino: SEE YOU.

00:41:11.646 --> 00:41:13.182
Asuna: THAT WAS FUN.

00:41:13.248 --> 00:41:14.049
EH?

00:41:14.116 --> 00:41:15.484
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:16.685
Kazuto: SAY WHAT?

00:41:16.751 --> 00:41:19.221
OH. NOTHING.

00:41:19.288 --> 00:41:21.223
♪♪

00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:27.496
( sighs )

00:41:29.498 --> 00:41:30.465
( Asuna sighs )

00:41:36.571 --> 00:41:37.739
TALK TO ME.

00:41:40.642 --> 00:41:42.011
Kazuto: ASUNA...

00:41:43.645 --> 00:41:46.248
I THINK I'M GONNA GO.

00:41:46.315 --> 00:41:48.217
‐ Asuna: TO AMERICA?
‐ Kazuto: YEAH.

00:41:48.283 --> 00:41:51.420
THE RESEARCH IS
WAY MORE ADVANCED THERE.

00:41:51.486 --> 00:41:53.922
IT'S ALL NEXT‐GEN STUFF.

00:41:53.988 --> 00:41:55.557
THEY'RE CREATING A NEW WORLD,

00:41:55.624 --> 00:41:59.494
AND I WANNA BE THERE
WHEN IT'S BORN.

00:41:59.561 --> 00:42:00.662
( Asuna chuckles )

00:42:00.729 --> 00:42:02.531
WE WERE HAPPY IN AINCRAD.

00:42:02.597 --> 00:42:06.000
BUT THERE WAS
SO MUCH PAIN AND SADNESS, TOO.

00:42:06.068 --> 00:42:07.302
YOU WANT TO FIND OUT

00:42:07.369 --> 00:42:09.538
WHY THAT CASTLE STILL
HAUNTS YOUR THOUGHTS

00:42:09.604 --> 00:42:12.607
AND WHERE THAT EXPERIENCE
IS TAKING YOU.

00:42:12.674 --> 00:42:15.077
Kazuto: EVEN IF I LIVED
A COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS,

00:42:15.144 --> 00:42:17.079
I DOUBT I'D EVER FIND THAT OUT.

00:42:17.146 --> 00:42:21.216
ANYWAY, I‐I WANT...

00:42:22.284 --> 00:42:25.187
I WANT YOU WITH ME,
ASUNA, ALWAYS.

00:42:25.254 --> 00:42:27.722
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME,

00:42:27.789 --> 00:42:32.161
AND I‐I KNOW THAT'S ASKING
A LOT, BUT THE TRUTH IS...

00:42:32.227 --> 00:42:34.829
I CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOU!

00:42:34.896 --> 00:42:36.365
( Asuna gasps )

00:42:36.431 --> 00:42:38.767
( sighs )

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.672
OF COURSE.
I'LL GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

00:42:43.738 --> 00:42:47.709
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE.
I'LL GO.

00:42:47.776 --> 00:42:49.378
Kazuto: ASUNA.

00:42:59.388 --> 00:43:00.589
( footsteps echoing )

00:43:00.655 --> 00:43:02.824
Asuna: SO DOES THIS MEAN
THE SOUL TRANSLATOR

00:43:02.891 --> 00:43:04.293
ISN'T THE NEXT STEP IN VR?

00:43:04.359 --> 00:43:07.396
HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT IT,
I THOUGHT IT WAS.

00:43:07.462 --> 00:43:10.499
Kazuto: EH, I DON'T KNOW.

00:43:10.565 --> 00:43:13.635
FOR SOME REASON,
I GET THE FEELING ITS PURPOSE

00:43:13.702 --> 00:43:16.238
ISN'T JUST TO FULL‐DIVE
IN VR WORLDS.

00:43:16.305 --> 00:43:17.939
Asuna: THEN WHAT'S IT FOR?

00:43:18.007 --> 00:43:19.308
Kazuto: A TOOL FOR LEARNING

00:43:19.374 --> 00:43:22.077
ABOUT FLUCTLIGHTS
AND HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:43:22.144 --> 00:43:23.712
Asuna: HMM?

00:43:23.778 --> 00:43:24.813
Kazuto: IT'S LIKE...

00:43:24.879 --> 00:43:28.350
WHATEVER I KNOW ABOUT THE S.T.L.
MAKES ME THINK

00:43:28.417 --> 00:43:31.420
IT MIGHT BE AN EXTENSION
OF KAYABA'S IDEAS.

00:43:31.486 --> 00:43:34.023
( Asuna gasps )
HE'S BEHIND IT?!

00:43:34.089 --> 00:43:36.591
Kazuto: I DON'T KNOW WHY HE
MADE THE NERVEGEAR AND "S. A. O."

00:43:36.658 --> 00:43:39.994
TO TRAP EVERYONE
AND MAKE US ALL SUFFER

00:43:40.062 --> 00:43:42.031
OR WHY HE'D FRY HIS OWN BRAIN.

00:43:42.097 --> 00:43:46.801
AND THE SEED, HE DIDN'T MAKE IT
JUST TO KEEP VR ALIVE.

00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:49.904
I WANNA KNOW
WHAT HIS ENDGAME WAS,

00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:51.440
BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO BE MINE.

00:43:51.506 --> 00:43:53.375
I'M NOT HIS PUPPET,

00:43:53.442 --> 00:43:56.178
AND IF I GO DOWN THAT ROAD,
I WOULD BE.

00:43:56.245 --> 00:43:57.546
Asuna: YOU SAID
YOU TALKED TO HIM

00:43:57.612 --> 00:43:59.881
OR THE PART OF HIM
HE LEFT BEHIND.

00:43:59.948 --> 00:44:01.316
Kazuto: YEAH.

00:44:01.383 --> 00:44:05.054
I THINK I KNOW WHY HE LEFT
A COPY OF HIMSELF OUT THERE,

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.688
AND IT MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

00:44:06.755 --> 00:44:09.791
WITH WHAT RATH'S UP TO
WITH THE S.T.L.

00:44:09.858 --> 00:44:11.093
‐ EH?
‐ Asuna: EH?

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.862
Man: HEY, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

00:44:13.928 --> 00:44:17.232
I'M SORTA LOST.
WHERE'S THE STATION?

00:44:17.299 --> 00:44:19.534
Asuna: OH, JUST DOWN THERE.

00:44:20.802 --> 00:44:22.737
KIRITO?

00:44:22.804 --> 00:44:25.307
Kazuto: YOU FOLLOWED US
FROM DICEY'S CAFE.

00:44:25.374 --> 00:44:26.708
( man sighs )

00:44:26.775 --> 00:44:29.211
THERE GOES MY PLAN
TO AMBUSH Y'ALL.

00:44:29.278 --> 00:44:30.312
Kazuto: WHO ARE YOU?

00:44:30.379 --> 00:44:32.214
Man: AH, COME ON, KIRITO.

00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:33.815
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?

00:44:33.882 --> 00:44:39.021
OH. THAT'S RIGHT.
I ALWAYS WORE A MASK BACK THERE.

00:44:39.088 --> 00:44:41.423
YEAH, NOW THAT
XAXA'S BEEN CAUGHT,

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:44.793
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT
TO FINISH THINGS BUT ME,

00:44:44.859 --> 00:44:48.230
THE LAST SURVIVOR
OF LAUGHING COFFIN...
