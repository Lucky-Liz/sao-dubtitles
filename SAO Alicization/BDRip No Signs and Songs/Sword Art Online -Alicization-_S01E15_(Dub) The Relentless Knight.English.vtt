00:21:17.535 --> 00:21:18.468
STOP IT.

00:21:21.338 --> 00:21:22.940
YOU DIDN'T COME THIS FAR

00:21:23.006 --> 00:21:26.243
'CAUSE YOU HATED
THE INTEGRITY KNIGHTS, DID YOU?

00:21:26.309 --> 00:21:29.446
YOU'RE HERE TO GET ALICE BACK.

00:21:29.513 --> 00:21:31.649
YOU'RE HERE 'CAUSE YOU LOVE HER.

00:21:31.715 --> 00:21:32.550
BUT GUESS WHAT.

00:21:32.616 --> 00:21:34.585
THAT INTEGRITY KNIGHT,

00:21:34.652 --> 00:21:37.020
SHE FEELS JUST AS STRONG
ABOUT HER DUTY,

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:39.189
AND I'M NO DIFFERENT.

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.324
I WANNA PROTECT
EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD‐‐

00:21:41.391 --> 00:21:44.027
YOU, ALICE,

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:46.263
EVEN THIS KNIGHT.

00:21:46.329 --> 00:21:48.231
WE'RE SO CLOSE,

00:21:48.298 --> 00:21:50.701
AND WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO GIVE UP NOW.

00:21:52.302 --> 00:21:54.972
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, EUGEO?

00:21:56.139 --> 00:21:57.541
( Eugeo sighs )

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:05.983
Kirito: ENHANCE ARMAMENT!
