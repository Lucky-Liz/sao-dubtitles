IS ALLOWED TO ENTER, EVER.

AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT
CAME TO OUR VILLAGE...

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:36.282
AND HE TOOK HER TO CENTORIA
TO BE EXECUTED.

00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:42.388
BUT I STILL BELIEVE
SHE'S ALIVE, KIRITO.

BE TESTERS, EITHER.

EUGEO AND THE VILLAGERS
WERE RAISED HERE FROM THE START,

BUT THE ONLY WAY
THAT COULD HAPPEN

HAVE TO ACCELERATE TIME
