00:14:09.898 --> 00:14:12.801
TWO MALES AND TWO FEMALES
CAME TO THIS LAND.

00:14:12.867 --> 00:14:16.305
EACH COUPLE RAISED EIGHT
CHILDREN EACH ON TWO FARMS.

00:14:16.371 --> 00:14:17.872
THEY TAUGHT THEM
TO READ AND WRITE

00:14:17.939 --> 00:14:21.743
AND HOW TO RAISE CROPS
AND LIVESTOCK, TOO,

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.579
AND THE MORAL ARGUMENTS
OF GOOD AND EVIL,

WHICH FORMED THE BASIS
OF THE TABOO INDEX.

THE FIRST FOUR

00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:32.587
WERE ABLE TO PASS DOWN
THESE TEACHINGS,

00:14:32.654 --> 00:14:34.523
IT'S CLEAR THAT, AS HUMANS,

00:14:34.589 --> 00:14:37.026
THEY WERE
INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT.

00:14:37.092 --> 00:14:38.427
HOWEVER...

00:14:38.493 --> 00:14:41.330

OF ALL THE UNDERWORLD'S
SYSTEM COMMANDS.

QUINELLA'S
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS

00:20:08.192 --> 00:20:11.962
WAS TO RESTORE HER LIFE
AND HALT THE AGING PROCESS.

00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:15.032
THEN SHE RESTORED HER BEAUTY.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.135
‐ IN AN INSTANT...
‐ ( thunder crashes )

00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:21.605
SHE REGAINED THE DAZZLING ALLURE
OF HER LATE TEENS.

Cardinal:
EVEN THE CARDINAL SYSTEM

00:20:38.255 --> 00:20:40.391
WAS SOMETHING
SHE DEEMED A THREAT,

00:20:40.457 --> 00:20:42.093
SO SHE DEVISED A WAY

00:20:42.159 --> 00:20:44.961
TO SEIZE THE CARDINAL SYSTEM'S
AUTHORITY LEVEL

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:48.665
USING A SACRED ART COMMAND
SHE COMPOSED.

00:20:48.732 --> 00:20:51.202
AS A RESULT...

00:20:51.268 --> 00:20:54.271
SHE BURNED THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
OF THE CARDINAL SYSTEM

00:20:54.338 --> 00:20:57.908
INTO HER FLUCTLIGHT
AS HER OWN BEHAVIORAL PRINCIPLE.

00:20:57.974 --> 00:21:00.677
THAT WAY,
IT COULD NOT BE OVERWRITTEN.

00:21:00.744 --> 00:21:03.447
SHE JUST WANTED
ITS AUTHORITY LEVEL.

00:21:03.514 --> 00:21:04.981
INSTEAD, SHE ENDED UP

00:21:05.049 --> 00:21:07.851
FUSING HER SOUL
WITH THE CARDINAL SYSTEM.

00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:09.420
"TO UPHOLD ORDER,"

00:21:09.486 --> 00:21:13.090
THAT IS THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
OF THE CARDINAL SYSTEM

00:21:13.157 --> 00:21:14.858
AND ITS REASON FOR EXISTING.

00:21:14.925 --> 00:21:16.860
AS SOMEONE
WHO SPENT TIME IN A WORLD

00:21:16.927 --> 00:21:20.097
CONTROLLED BY THE SAME SYSTEM,
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.

00:21:20.164 --> 00:21:23.534
CARDINAL OBSERVES THE ACTIONS
OF PLAYERS LIKE YOU,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.801
AND IT CORRECTS ANYTHING

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.937
THAT DISRUPTS
THE BALANCE OF THE WORLD

00:21:27.004 --> 00:21:29.306
