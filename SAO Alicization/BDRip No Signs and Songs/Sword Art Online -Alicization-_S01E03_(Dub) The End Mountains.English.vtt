I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,

BUT I REMEMBER ALICE SAYING

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:50.537
THERE WAS
A HIGH‐LEVEL SACRED ART

00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:52.338
THAT COULD STOP A LIFE
FROM DECREASING.

00:04:52.404 --> 00:04:55.708
Kirito: THAT'D BE
A GOOD ONE TO KNOW, I GUESS.

00:04:55.775 --> 00:04:56.809
Eugeo: IT WOULD.

00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:59.345
ALICE SAID SHE FOUND
A PASSAGE ABOUT THAT SPELL

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.714
IN ONE OF THE OLD BOOKS
IN THE CHURCH.

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:02.949
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,

00:05:03.015 --> 00:05:05.918
ONLY THE HIGH PRIESTS
AT THE AXIOM CHURCH CAN USE IT.

00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:07.286

Kirito: BUT, LIKE,
DO YOU HAVE TO BE

00:05:12.158 --> 00:05:13.760
A HIGH PRIEST TO USE THE SPELL?

00:05:13.826 --> 00:05:15.895
MAYBE SOMEONE LIKE YOU OR ME
COULD LEARN IT.

00:05:18.164 --> 00:05:19.298
Eugeo: NO.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:20.967
IT'S NOT
FOR REGULAR FOLK LIKE US.

00:05:21.033 --> 00:05:23.770

THE MORE ELABORATE THE ART,
THE MORE SACRED POWER IT TAKES.

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.380
IT WOULD TAKE MORE POWER
THAN THIS FOREST HAS,

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:36.916
AND NO ONE FROM HERE
TO ZAKKARIA COULD WIELD IT.

00:05:38.618 --> 00:05:39.752

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.554

00:08:59.654 --> 00:09:01.756
HEY, EUGEO? COULD YOU, LIKE,

00:09:01.823 --> 00:09:03.925
CHECK HOW MUCH LIFE
THE GIGAS CEDAR HAS NOW?

00:09:03.992 --> 00:09:05.694
Eugeo: DON'T TELL ME.
LET ME GUESS.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.096
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY
STRIKING IT WITH THE SWORD.

00:09:08.162 --> 00:09:10.264
Kirito:
YOU'RE DAMN STRAIGHT, I AM.

00:09:10.331 --> 00:09:12.300
UNLESS THE TABOO INDEX
FORBIDS IT,

00:09:12.366 --> 00:09:13.768
BUT I BET IT DOESN'T, DOES IT?

00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:15.637
( Eugeo chuckles )
NO, IT DOESN'T.

00:09:15.704 --> 00:09:18.907
IT'S FUNNY.
ALL THIS SEEMS SO FAMILIAR.

00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:27.849
RIGHT NOW, IT'S AT 232,315.

00:09:27.916 --> 00:09:30.118
Kirito: COOL. REMEMBER THAT.

00:09:30.184 --> 00:09:31.119
( hands scraping )

00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:33.121
( grunts )

00:09:34.689 --> 00:09:37.225

Eugeo: DID YOU HURT YOURSELF?!

00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:53.708
Kirito: NO, I'M OKAY.

00:09:53.775 --> 00:09:56.945
Eugeo: I TOLD YOU BEFORE.
THAT TREE IS TOUGH.

00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:57.946
( gasps )

00:09:59.413 --> 00:10:02.984
NO WAY.
YOU ACTUALLY CUT INTO IT.

00:10:06.254 --> 00:10:08.022
AND DEEP, TOO.

00:10:08.089 --> 00:10:11.059
Kirito: GO ON.
SEE WHERE ITS LIFE'S AT NOW.

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:12.561
Eugeo: OH. RIGHT.

00:10:14.262 --> 00:10:17.165
232,314.

00:10:17.231 --> 00:10:18.533
Kirito: YOU'RE KIDDING!

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.802
IT ONLY WENT DOWN ONE POINT?!

00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:22.937
Eugeo: YOUR HIT LANDED
IN THE WRONG SPOT.

00:10:23.004 --> 00:10:25.907
I BET IT WOULD HAVE
DECREASED ITS LIFE A LOT MORE

00:10:25.974 --> 00:10:28.910
IF YOU GOT IT IN THE CENTER
OF THE CUT INSTEAD OF THE BARK.

00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:31.613
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR INTUITION WAS RIGHT.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.948
THE SWORD IS
MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE AX.

00:10:34.015 --> 00:10:38.186
EVEN SO, WE'D HAVE TO MASTER
USING IT TO GET ANY RESULTS.

00:10:38.252 --> 00:10:40.889
Kirito: I CAN'T HIT IT STRAIGHT,
BUT I BET YOU COULD.

00:10:40.955 --> 00:10:43.825
Eugeo: I CAN BARELY HOLD
THE SWORD, LET ALONE SWING IT.

00:10:43.892 --> 00:10:45.459
Kirito: IT'S ALL
ABOUT TECHNIQUE,

00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:46.995
AND I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:48.763
( Eugeo sighs )

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.032
OKAY, I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:55.036
( grunting )

00:10:57.138 --> 00:10:58.807
S‐SO HEAVY!

00:10:58.873 --> 00:11:00.642
Kirito: FIRST THING,
FIND YOUR BALANCE,

00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:02.577
AND WHEN YOU SWING,
SWING WITH YOUR BODY.

00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:04.345
WITH SWORDS,
IT'S MORE ABOUT MOMENTUM,

00:11:04.412 --> 00:11:05.580
NOT JUST ARM STRENGTH.

00:11:05.647 --> 00:11:06.915
Eugeo: MM‐HMM.

00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:13.021

( Eugeo grunting )

00:11:27.969 --> 00:11:29.337
Kirito: HEY! YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:11:29.403 --> 00:11:31.940
Eugeo: I THINK
I LOST SOME LIFE ON THAT ONE.

00:11:32.006 --> 00:11:35.043
Kirito: OH, WELL.
IT WAS A GOOD TRY.

00:11:39.113 --> 00:11:41.382
( gasps )

00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:47.789
IF DURABILITY'S LIFE,
I LOST SOME WHEN I TOOK A SWING.

00:11:47.856 --> 00:11:51.860
HMM. IT SAYS MY OBJECT CONTROL
AUTHORITY'S AT 38.

00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:54.028
I GUESS THAT'S MY PARAMETER.

00:11:57.999 --> 00:12:00.168
THE SWORD'S IS HIGHER.

00:12:01.135 --> 00:12:03.938
‐ ( water splashes )
‐ ( sighs )

00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:06.307
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

( deep breath )

00:12:08.276 --> 00:12:11.479
AT THIS RATE,
I'LL NEVER GET TO CENTORIA.

00:12:11.546 --> 00:12:16.217
I NEED EUGEO'S HELP, BUT HE
WON'T BAIL ON HIS CALLING.

00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:19.621
IF IT WASN'T
FOR THAT TABOO INDEX,

00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:21.623
HE COULD DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.759
HE SAID THE AXIOM CHURCH
CAME UP WITH IT.

00:12:24.826 --> 00:12:26.895
WONDER WHAT THE DEAL IS
WITH THEM.

00:12:26.961 --> 00:12:29.964
IF I'M RIGHT AND THESE PEOPLE
ARE A.I. FLUCTLIGHTS

00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:31.966
IN A SIMULATED CIVILIZATION,

00:12:32.033 --> 00:12:35.704
THERE'S NO WAY THE SYSTEM
WOULD LET 'EM BREAK A RULE.

00:12:37.105 --> 00:12:38.006
HANG ON.

00:12:38.072 --> 00:12:40.809
EUGEO SAID ALICE
BROKE THE TABOO INDEX

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:43.845
WHEN SHE ACCIDENTALLY
CROSSED INTO THE DARK TERRITORY,

00:12:43.912 --> 00:12:46.748
BUT SHE WAS THERE BY CHOICE.

00:12:46.815 --> 00:12:49.383
SHE WENT AGAINST THE SYSTEM.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.920
SO IS SHE NOT AN A.I.?

00:12:51.986 --> 00:12:54.288
Selka: HELLO?
IS SOMEONE IN THERE?

00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:55.590
Kirito: Y‐YEAH, THERE IS!

00:12:55.657 --> 00:12:56.925
I‐I'M ALMOST DONE!

00:12:56.991 --> 00:13:00.595
Selka: OH! UM, NO.
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TIME.

00:13:00.662 --> 00:13:01.896
I WAS JUST CHECKING.

00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:03.865
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
GOOD NIGHT.

00:13:03.932 --> 00:13:05.767
Kirito: UH, SELKA!

00:13:05.834 --> 00:13:07.536
I WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

00:13:07.602 --> 00:13:09.070
Selka: MM...

00:13:10.574 --> 00:13:12.509

‐ MM?

00:13:18.314 --> 00:13:21.351
Selka: SO? WHAT WAS IT
YOU WANTED TO ASK ME?

00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:22.786
Kirito: YEAH.

00:13:25.455 --> 00:13:26.957
UM...

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:30.226
IT'S ABOUT YOUR OLDER SISTER.

00:13:30.293 --> 00:13:31.528
( Selka gasps )

00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:33.396
Kirito: I HEARD ABOUT HER,

00:13:33.463 --> 00:13:34.798
YOU KNOW, FROM EUGEO.

00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:38.301
AND, LIKE, HE TOLD ME
HER NAME WAS ALICE.

00:13:38.368 --> 00:13:39.603
Selka: HE DID, DID HE?

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.839
WHAT ELSE DID HE TELL YOU,
BESIDES HER NAME WAS ALICE?

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:45.609
Kirito: OH, UM,
HE SAID SHE WAS STUDYING

00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:47.511
THE SACRED ARTS
HERE AT THE CHURCH

00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:50.581
AND HOW, SIX YEARS AGO,
AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT TOOK HER.

00:13:50.647 --> 00:13:53.183
I GOT THE FEELING
HE'S REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HER.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:58.354
Selka: I DIDN'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT HE FORGOT ABOUT HER.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.991
THIS EXPLAINS A LOT
ABOUT HIM, THOUGH.

00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:03.259
SHE'S THE REASON EUGEO'S SO SAD.

00:14:03.326 --> 00:14:06.029
Kirito: I DIDN'T GET THAT.
HE SEEMS FINE.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.899
Selka: HE'S NOT.
YOU HAD TO HAVE NOTICED IT,

00:14:08.965 --> 00:14:10.901
HOW QUIET AND GLOOMY HE IS.

00:14:10.967 --> 00:14:12.969
Kirito: OH. YEAH.

00:14:13.036 --> 00:14:15.005
Selka: WHEN MY SISTER WAS HERE,

00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:18.274
EVERY TIME I SAW HIM,
HE HAD A SMILE ON HIS FACE.

00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:22.078
I DON'T REMEMBER EVER SEEING HIM
WITHOUT ONE BACK THEN.

00:14:22.145 --> 00:14:26.517
BUT NOT ANY MORE. HE SPENDS
HIS DAYS OF REST ALONE,

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:29.853
AND THE ONLY TIME I SEE HIM
IS WHEN HE GOES TO THE FOREST.

00:14:31.354 --> 00:14:32.255
Kirito: SELKA...

00:14:32.322 --> 00:14:33.757
YOU REALLY LIKE HIM, DON'T YOU?

00:14:33.824 --> 00:14:34.991
( Selka squeals )

00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:37.628
I DIDN'T SAY THAT! OH, MY GOSH!

00:14:37.694 --> 00:14:39.530
( Kirito laughs )

00:14:40.831 --> 00:14:42.699
Selka: EVERYONE
COMPARES ME TO ALICE.

00:14:42.766 --> 00:14:44.400
NO ONE SAYS IT, BUT I KNOW.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:48.271
WHEN MY PARENTS SEE ME,
I REMIND THEM OF HER,

00:14:48.338 --> 00:14:50.273
AND I CAN'T STAND IT ANY MORE.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.710
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY EUGEO AVOIDS ME.

00:14:53.777 --> 00:14:56.046
WHEN HE SEES ME,
HE THINKS OF HER,

00:14:56.112 --> 00:14:58.248
AND I CAN TELL
IT MAKES HIM SAD.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.818
BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

00:15:01.885 --> 00:15:04.187
IT'S NOT MY FAULT SHE'S GONE.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.490
( gasps )

00:15:07.558 --> 00:15:10.426
I'M SORRY.
I'M ACTING LIKE A BABY.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.462
Kirito: NO, NOT AT ALL.

00:15:12.529 --> 00:15:14.030
IT'S GOOD TO CRY.

00:15:14.097 --> 00:15:16.099
IT'S BETTER THAN HOLDIN' IT IN.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.802
Selka: YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:15:18.869 --> 00:15:21.772
IN FACT, I FEEL
MUCH BETTER ALREADY.

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.774
CRYING IN FRONT OF OTHERS IS...

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.075
NOT SOMETHING I DO.

00:15:25.141 --> 00:15:28.278
Kirito: REALLY?
YOU'RE TOUGHER THAN I AM.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:32.248
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE CRIED IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.

00:15:33.249 --> 00:15:35.619
Selka: HOLD ON.
IS YOUR MEMORY BACK?

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:38.522
Kirito: NO! I‐IT JUST
FEELS THAT WAY, IS ALL!

00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:40.223
A‐ANYWAY, BACK TO YOU.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.292
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT ANYONE THINKS.

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:44.394
YOU'RE YOU, NOT YOUR SISTER.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.298
YOU CAN ONLY LIVE YOUR LIFE,
NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S.

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:50.100
( Selka chuckles )
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:15:54.104 --> 00:15:55.672

SAY...

00:15:58.742 --> 00:16:00.577
DID EUGEO HAPPEN TO TELL YOU

00:16:00.644 --> 00:16:03.714
WHY THE INTEGRITY KNIGHT
TOOK MY SISTER AWAY?

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.782
Kirito: UM, YEAH. HE DID.

00:16:05.849 --> 00:16:07.851
Selka: MY PARENTS
WOULDN'T TELL ME,

00:16:07.918 --> 00:16:10.286
AND EUGEO
WOULDN'T TELL ME, EITHER.

00:16:10.353 --> 00:16:12.556
MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME WHY?

00:16:12.623 --> 00:16:16.126
Kirito: YEAH, SURE.
SHE WENT TO THE END MOUNTAINS,

00:16:16.192 --> 00:16:20.096
THEN TOUCHED THE GROUND
ON THE DARK TERRITORY SIDE.

00:16:20.163 --> 00:16:23.033
Selka: I SEE.
THE END MOUNTAINS, HUH?

00:16:23.099 --> 00:16:24.568
Kirito: UH...

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.071
Selka: TOMORROW IS
OUR DAY OF REST.

00:16:28.138 --> 00:16:29.439
STILL, BE ON TIME.

00:16:29.506 --> 00:16:31.474
I WON'T BE COMING
TO WAKE YOU UP ANY MORE.

00:16:31.542 --> 00:16:34.377
Kirito: OKAY.
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

00:16:36.713 --> 00:16:38.214

Kirito: UH, OH, GOOD MORNING.

00:16:54.397 --> 00:16:57.467
Azalia: BY CHANCE,
HAVE YOU SEEN SELKA TODAY?

00:16:57.534 --> 00:16:59.736
Kirito: NO.
I JUST WOKE UP, ACTUALLY.

00:16:59.803 --> 00:17:04.107
Azalia: SO I SEE. WELL,
I HAVE NOT SEEN HER ALL MORNING.

00:17:04.174 --> 00:17:07.377
SHE MISSED PRAYERS,
AND SHE IS NOT IN HER ROOM.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:11.114
I AM WORRIED. SHE WOULD NEVER
LEAVE WITHOUT TELLING ME FIRST.

00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:12.583
Kirito: I'M SURE SHE'S AROUND.

00:17:12.649 --> 00:17:16.653
Azalia: I HOPE SO. IF YOU
SEE HER, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.721
Kirito: YES, MA'AM.

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:20.524
EUGEO!

Kirito: HAVE YOU
SEEN SELKA ANYWHERE?

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.195
Eugeo: I HAVEN'T. WHY?

00:17:25.261 --> 00:17:28.098
Kirito: SISTER AZALIA'S
BEEN LOOKING FOR HER.

00:17:28.164 --> 00:17:29.800
SHE SAYS SHE LEFT
WITHOUT TELLING HER.

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:31.101
Eugeo: THAT'S STRANGE.

00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:32.468
Kirito: WELL,
I'M TRYIN' TO FIND HER.

00:17:32.536 --> 00:17:34.004
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE COULD'VE GONE?

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.107
Eugeo: NO. SHE AND I
HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN AGES.

00:17:37.173 --> 00:17:39.576
DO YOU THINK SOMETHING
MIGHT HAVE UPSET HER?

00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:41.111
Kirito: UH...

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.079
Selka: I SEE.

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.948
THE END MOUNTAINS, HUH?

00:17:45.015 --> 00:17:46.950
Kirito: AW, MAN. LAST NIGHT,

00:17:47.017 --> 00:17:48.652
I TOLD HER
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALICE,

00:17:48.719 --> 00:17:50.854
AT LEAST, EVERYTHING
YOU TOLD ME THAT HAPPENED.

00:17:50.921 --> 00:17:52.022
( Eugeo gasps )

00:17:52.088 --> 00:17:53.256
Kirito: SHE WOULDN'T GO

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.926
TO THE END MOUNTAINS
ON HER OWN, WOULD SHE?

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.961
Eugeo: THAT'S EXACTLY
WHERE SHE WENT!

00:17:58.028 --> 00:18:00.296
WE HAVE TO BRING HER BACK NOW!

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:09.072
Kirito: WHAT'S WRONG?

00:18:09.139 --> 00:18:11.207
Eugeo: IT'S BEEN STEPPED ON.

00:18:14.277 --> 00:18:15.946
IT'S LOST A BIT OF LIFE.

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:19.049
SOMEONE'S BEEN BY HERE,
AND IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.

00:18:19.115 --> 00:18:20.751
Kirito: THEN WE'RE
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

00:18:20.817 --> 00:18:22.619
‐ THAT'S GOTTA BE SELKA.
‐ Eugeo: YEAH.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.661
WELL, THIS IS IT.

00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:32.696
Kirito: NO WAY.

00:18:32.763 --> 00:18:34.698
IT REALLY IS THE END.

00:18:34.765 --> 00:18:38.802
Eugeo: WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE,
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING.

00:18:38.869 --> 00:18:42.973
Kirito: AND THE DARK TERRITORY'S
DOWN THAT WAY, HUH?

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.140
Eugeo: YEAH. ARE YOU READY?

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.342
Kirito: YEAH, I THINK. I GUESS.

00:18:46.409 --> 00:18:48.178
‐ Eugeo: SYSTEM CALL.
‐ ( Kirito gasps )

00:18:48.244 --> 00:18:50.847
Eugeo: GENERATE
LUMINOUS ELEMENT.

00:18:50.914 --> 00:18:53.216
ADHERE.

00:18:53.283 --> 00:18:55.418
Kirito: E‐EUGEO! WHAT'D YOU DO?

00:18:55.485 --> 00:18:57.153
Eugeo: IT'S A SACRED ART,

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.189
AN EASY ONE THAT ANYBODY CAN DO.

00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:01.257
Kirito: BUT, LIKE,
YOU SAID, "SYSTEM."

00:19:01.324 --> 00:19:02.593
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

00:19:02.659 --> 00:19:05.061
Eugeo: NOTHING.
IT'S JUST A WORD,

00:19:05.128 --> 00:19:06.296
WELL, A COMMAND.

00:19:06.362 --> 00:19:07.998
IT'S TO CALL ON THE GODS.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.499
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE
ENOUGH SKILL,

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.334
YOU'LL BE BLESSED
WITH THE ART YOU SUMMON.

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:14.304
Kirito: HE THINKS
HE'S CASTING A MAGIC SPELL.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.239
Eugeo: COME ON. LET'S GO.

00:19:16.306 --> 00:19:17.473
Kirito: RIGHT.

00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:20.210
♪♪

00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:24.548
‐ ( breeze blowing )
‐ ( Kirito shivers )

00:19:24.615 --> 00:19:26.617
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T COME IN HERE.

00:19:26.683 --> 00:19:28.251
I MEAN, THERE'S NO SIGN OF HER.

00:19:28.318 --> 00:19:30.420
( Eugeo gasps )

00:19:32.488 --> 00:19:35.025
THIS IS AS GOOD A SIGN AS ANY.

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.160
Kirito:
IT COULD BE HER, I GUESS.

00:19:40.664 --> 00:19:42.032
HEY, EUGEO.

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:43.333
Eugeo: WHAT IS IT?

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:45.636
Kirito: IF SHE CROSSES
INTO THE DARK TERRITORY,

00:19:45.702 --> 00:19:48.338
DOES AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT COME
AND TAKE HER RIGHT AWAY?

00:19:48.404 --> 00:19:50.874
Eugeo: NO,
NOT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY.

00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:54.110
HE'LL FLY TO THE VILLAGE
AND ARREST HER THERE,

00:19:54.177 --> 00:19:55.512
JUST LIKE SIX YEARS AGO.

00:19:55.579 --> 00:19:57.748
Kirito: THEN,
EVEN IF WE'RE TOO LATE,

00:19:57.814 --> 00:20:00.250
WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE
TO KEEP HIM FROM GETTIN' HER.

00:20:00.316 --> 00:20:01.484
( Eugeo sighs )

00:20:01.552 --> 00:20:03.654
BUT THAT WOULD BE INTERFERING.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.055
WE CAN'T.

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.389
Kirito: OF COURSE WE CAN.

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:09.225
LOOK, EVEN IF SHE DOES
BREAK THE TABOO INDEX,

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.762
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
KEEP HER AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE.

00:20:11.828 --> 00:20:13.429
THE INTEGRITY KNIGHT
CAN'T ARREST HER

00:20:13.496 --> 00:20:14.831
IF HE CAN'T FIND HER.

00:20:14.898 --> 00:20:16.399
Eugeo: THAT'S INSANE.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:19.903
WE CAN'T HIDE FOREVER,
AND I HAVE MY CALLING.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.073
Kirito: BUT I DON'T,
SO I CAN TAKE HER AWAY.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:26.877
IF I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
SHE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS.

00:20:26.943 --> 00:20:28.144
THIS IS ALL ON ME.

00:20:28.211 --> 00:20:30.146
Eugeo: NO, IT'S NOT.

00:20:30.213 --> 00:20:31.314
( Selka screams )

00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:32.949
Eugeo: SELKA!

00:20:36.553 --> 00:20:37.821
THAT WAY!

00:20:44.761 --> 00:20:46.329
Kirito: TAKE COVER.

00:20:53.303 --> 00:20:54.437
( gasps )

00:20:55.939 --> 00:20:57.741
( goblins laugh, chatter )

00:20:58.809 --> 00:20:59.910
( goblin growls )

00:21:01.077 --> 00:21:04.214
Kirito: CRAP. GOBLINS.

00:21:08.752 --> 00:21:10.020
( gasps )

00:21:10.086 --> 00:21:11.354
( Eugeo gasps )

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:14.290
SELKA!

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:16.893
Kirito: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.862
( goblin growls )

00:21:18.929 --> 00:21:21.497
( goblins murmuring )

00:21:22.966 --> 00:21:24.935
Goblin #2: LOOKIE, LOOKIE!

00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:28.905
TWO MORE WHITE IUM BRATTY‐BRATS,
JUST A‐WANDERING AROUND!

00:21:28.972 --> 00:21:32.075
Goblin #3: YUMMY.
LET'S TIE 'EM TO THE OTHER ONE.

00:21:32.142 --> 00:21:33.877
( both laugh )

00:21:33.944 --> 00:21:35.178
Goblin #4: SILENCE!

00:21:35.245 --> 00:21:37.848
THEY'RE MALE IUMS.

00:21:37.914 --> 00:21:40.651
WE TAKE 'EM BACK,
NO ONE BUY 'EM.

00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:44.220
WORTHLESS. KILL 'EM,
AND MAKE 'EM MEAT INSTEAD.

00:21:44.287 --> 00:21:46.389
( goblins chuckling )

00:21:46.456 --> 00:21:48.424
Kirito: EUGEO.

00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:51.094
( Eugeo gasping )

00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:53.296
Kirito: E‐EUGEO?

00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:57.534
EUGEO!

00:21:57.601 --> 00:21:59.269
( Eugeo continues gasping )

00:21:59.335 --> 00:22:00.904
Kirito: EUGEO!

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.741
EUGEO!
