♪♪

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:07.139
Asuna: TAKE ME TO KIRITO.

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:11.510
Higa: WELL, THERE YOU GO.

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:13.845
I TOLD YOU YOUR BOY
WAS THE BIGGEST THREAT

00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:15.547
TO THIS PROJECT'S SECURITY.

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.882
Kikuoka: I KNOW.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUB IT IN.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.984
Asuna: IS KIRITO
EVEN SAFE HERE?!

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.554
WERE YOU LYING WHEN YOU SAID
YOU COULD SAVE HIM?

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.490
IS HE ALIVE?! ANSWER ME!

00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:27.892
( Kikuoka sighs )

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:30.762
KANEMOTO INJECTED
A POTENT TOXIN INTO HIM.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.065
IT DAMAGED
KIRITO'S BRAIN SO MUCH,

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:35.500
CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT
CAN'T HEAL HIM.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:36.735
( Asuna shudders )

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:39.638
Kikuoka: BUT
UNCONVENTIONAL TREATMENT CAN,

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:42.274
AND THE ONLY PLACE
WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY IS RATH.

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:43.542
( Asuna gasps )

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:45.077
Kikuoka: I'M SURE
HE TOLD YOU ABOUT IT,

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:48.680
THE S.T.L.,
SHORT FOR "SOUL TRANSLATOR."

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:52.651
IF WE USE THE S.T.L.
TO STIMULATE HIS FLUCTLIGHT,

00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:54.386
WE CAN REGENERATE
A BRAND‐NEW,

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.488
PERFECTLY HEALTHY
NEURAL NETWORK,

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:57.822
BUT THAT TAKES TIME.

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:00.892
RIGHT NOW,
HE'S IN A FULL‐SPEC S.T.L.,

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:02.994
WHICH CAN ONLY BE FOUND HERE.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.596
THE TREATMENT HE'S GETTING

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:07.432
SURPASSES WHAT
ANY HOSPITAL CAN OFFER.

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:10.169
HE EVEN HAS
HIS OWN FULL‐TIME NURSE.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:13.738
Asuna: OKAY, THEN.
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:16.075
Rinko: ALL RIGHT, KIKUOKA.

00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:17.842
SINCE YOU'RE
IN THE MOOD TO TALK,

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.245
MIGHT AS WELL TELL US
EVERYTHING FROM THE TOP.

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:23.448
FIRST, WHY IS
AN S.D.F. OFFICIAL LIKE YOU

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.017
USING THE MINISTRY AS A FRONT?

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.619
NEXT, WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS?

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:30.522
AND LAST,
WHY KIRIGAYA, SPECIFICALLY?

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:33.792
Kikuoka: IF YOU WANT ANSWERS,
YOU'LL HAVE TO SIGN ON.

00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:35.294
Rinko: HOW 'BOUT
YOU START TALKING?

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:38.330
Kikuoka: ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:42.101
I ASSUME YOU'RE BOTH FAMILIAR
WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE S.T.L.?

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:44.036
Asuna: IT READS SOULS,

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.238
OR FLUCTLIGHTS,
AS YOU CALL THEM,

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.706
AND ALLOWS THE USER TO DIVE

00:01:47.772 --> 00:01:49.874
INTO A VIRTUAL WORLD
THAT'S INCREDIBLY LIFELIKE.

00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:52.844
Kikuoka: THAT'S CORRECT.
AND DO YOU KNOW

00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:55.547
WHAT THE OBJECTIVE
OF THIS PROJECT IS?

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:56.848
Asuna: NO, I DON'T.

00:01:58.583 --> 00:01:59.951
Kikuoka: TO CREATE A BOTTOM‐UP,

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.255
MULTIPURPOSE
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:40.767
Asuna: A BOTTOM‐UP,
MULTIPURPOSE A.I.?

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:42.069
Kikuoka: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:03:42.135 --> 00:03:44.404
THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES
TO DEVELOPING AN A.I.

00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.307
THE FIRST IS CALLED TOP‐DOWN
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,

00:03:47.374 --> 00:03:50.310
WHERE THE A.I. IS PROGRAMMED
WITH EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE

00:03:50.377 --> 00:03:51.478
SO THAT IT LEARNS ENOUGH

00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:53.713
TO APPROACH SOMETHING
CLOSE TO TRUE INTELLIGENCE.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.748
Higa: THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE GIST OF IT.

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:57.484
EVERYTHING
THAT'S AN A.I. RIGHT NOW

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.019
IS USING THAT TOP‐DOWN APPROACH.

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:02.155
HECK, DR. SHIGEMURA WAS
WORKIN' WITH US HERE FOR A BIT,

00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:04.624
AND EVEN HIS RESEARCH
FOCUSED ON THAT.

00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.559
Kikuoka:
A TOP‐DOWN A.I., HOWEVER,

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:07.860
CAN'T REACT APPROPRIATELY

00:04:07.927 --> 00:04:09.862
TO THINGS
IT HASN'T LEARNED ABOUT.

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:11.231
AT THIS POINT IN TIME,

00:04:11.298 --> 00:04:14.201
NONE HAVE EVOLVED ENOUGH
TO HAVE TRUE INTELLIGENCE.

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:17.637
THE SECOND APPROACH
TO A.I. DEVELOPMENT

00:04:17.704 --> 00:04:19.006
IS CALLED BOTTOM‐UP.

00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:21.108
THE HUMAN BRAIN IS AN ORGAN

00:04:21.174 --> 00:04:23.410
COMPRISED
OF ONE HUNDRED BILLION CELLS

00:04:23.476 --> 00:04:25.412
CONNECTED IN INTRICATE WAYS.

00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:26.813
THE IDEA OF BOTTOM‐UP

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.915
IS RECREATING THE BRAIN
ELECTRONICALLY

00:04:28.981 --> 00:04:30.983
AND GENERATING
TRUE INTELLIGENCE IN IT.

00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:32.952
Asuna: BUT THAT
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.555
Kikuoka: YOU'RE RIGHT,
AND, UNTIL NOW, IT WAS.

00:04:35.622 --> 00:04:39.326
BUT WITH THE SOUL TRANSLATOR,
WE CAN SCAN A HUMAN SOUL,

00:04:39.392 --> 00:04:42.429
OR SPECIFICALLY
THE QUANTUM FIELD IN BRAIN CELLS

00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:43.896
WE CALL THE FLUCTLIGHT.

00:04:43.963 --> 00:04:45.798
Higa: IF YOU'RE WONDERING
WHERE WE'RE GONNA PUT

00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:48.901
ALL THE DATA OF A HUMAN BRAIN,
STOP WONDERING.

00:04:48.968 --> 00:04:51.071
WE MADE THE LIGHT
QUANTUM GATE CRYSTAL,

00:04:51.138 --> 00:04:53.973
OR LIGHTCUBE, TO STORE
ALL THAT GOOD STUFF ON.

00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:56.209
Rinko: THEORETICALLY,
YOU COULD SAVE

00:04:56.276 --> 00:04:58.411
A ONE‐TO‐ONE COPY
OF A FLUCTLIGHT.

00:04:58.478 --> 00:04:59.979
Kikuoka: THAT'S CORRECT,

00:05:00.047 --> 00:05:02.182
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT A THEORY.

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.817
WE'VE ALREADY COPIED
A HUMAN SOUL.

00:05:04.884 --> 00:05:06.086
( both gasp )

00:05:06.153 --> 00:05:07.987
Rinko: BUT THEN,
WHY'D YOU BOTHER

00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:09.489
ASKING ME TO COME HELP YOU?

00:05:09.556 --> 00:05:13.560
Kikuoka: BECAUSE, LIKE IDIOTS,
WE MISSED SOMETHING.

00:05:13.626 --> 00:05:15.495
THE HUMAN SOUL IS COMPLEX.

00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:17.197
SURE, WE CAN COPY IT,

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:20.667
BUT THERE'S A WIDE GAP
BETWEEN IT AND A TRUE A.I.

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:21.834
‐ HIGA.
‐ Higa: EH?

00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:23.970
Kikuoka: GO ON.

00:05:24.037 --> 00:05:25.738
SHOW OUR GUESTS A DEMONSTRATION.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:27.740
Higa: DAMN. YOU'RE SADISTIC.

00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:30.077
( sighs )

00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:35.882
Male: IS THE SAMPLING DONE YET?

00:05:35.948 --> 00:05:39.152
Higa: YUP. NO PROBLEMS.
LOOKING GOOD.

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.291
Male: SWEET! SO WHY'S IT DARK,
AND HOW COME I CAN'T MOVE?

00:05:44.357 --> 00:05:45.458
OH, I KNOW WHY.

00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:47.727
LET ME OUT.
THE S.T.L.'s GLITCHIN'.

00:05:47.794 --> 00:05:50.497
Higa: SORRY, BUDDY.
I CAN'T LOG YOU OUT.

00:05:50.563 --> 00:05:51.998
Male: DUDE, WHAT THE HELL?

00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:53.266
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:55.868
WHO ARE YOU?!
I DON'T RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE!

00:05:55.935 --> 00:05:59.006
Higa: TAKERU HIGA.
YOU KNOW THAT.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.610
Male: WHAT?! NO WAY! I'M HIGA!

00:06:03.676 --> 00:06:04.811
LET ME OUT, AND YOU'LL SEE!

00:06:04.877 --> 00:06:06.079
Higa: RELAX.

00:06:06.146 --> 00:06:08.981
YOU'RE TAKERU HIGA, THE COPY.

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:10.717
I KNOW YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:11.984
SO JUST ACCEPT
THE SITUATION AN‐‐

00:06:12.052 --> 00:06:14.354
Higa copy: SCREW YOU! I'M ME!

00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:16.956
IF I'M A COPY,
THEN I'D KNOW IT, GOD DAMN IT!

00:06:17.024 --> 00:06:18.858
COME ON! PLEASE!

00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:21.794
LET ME OUT,
YOU SON OF A BITCH, RIGHT NOW!

00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:23.296
Kikuoka: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

00:06:23.363 --> 00:06:25.532
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.
IF YOU CAN'T THINK RATIONALLY,

00:06:25.598 --> 00:06:27.467
YOUR FLUCTLIGHT WON'T BE ABLE
TO TAKE THE STRAIN.

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:28.635
Higa copy: I AM RATIONAL!

00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.971
OKAY, THEN! LET'S SEE
WHO'S FASTER AT PI,

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.306
ME OR THAT FAKER!

00:06:33.373 --> 00:06:36.143
3.141592653589793...

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:39.246
( accelerated speech, static )

00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:44.884
( Higa sighs )

00:06:44.951 --> 00:06:48.488
FULL COLLAPSE,
ONE MINUTE, EIGHT SECONDS.

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:49.989
( Asuna gags )

00:06:50.057 --> 00:06:51.758
Rinko: ALL RIGHT,
THAT WAS BEYOND TWISTED!

00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:53.426
Kikuoka: IT IS DISTURBING.

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:55.862
STILL, IT'S THE BEST WAY
TO EXPLAIN

00:06:55.928 --> 00:06:58.165
WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE
TO ACCOMPLISH UP TO NOW.

00:06:58.231 --> 00:06:59.532
I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO SEE IT.

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.902
WE COPIED OVER A DOZEN
FLUCTLIGHTS, INCLUDING MINE,

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:05.005
AND SUBMITTED THEM
TO THE SAME TEST.

00:07:05.072 --> 00:07:06.639
THE RESULTS
WERE ALWAYS THE SAME.

00:07:06.706 --> 00:07:09.409
THEIR LOGIC SYSTEMS WENT
HAYWIRE, AND THEY COLLAPSED.

00:07:09.476 --> 00:07:12.145
SINCE MATURE FLUCTLIGHTS
DON'T WORK,

00:07:12.212 --> 00:07:13.346
WHAT WOULD YOU TRY NEXT?

00:07:13.413 --> 00:07:15.948
Rinko: MAYBE WIPE
THEIR MEMORIES.

00:07:16.016 --> 00:07:18.518
OR RAISE A SOUL FROM SCRATCH.

00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:19.519
Asuna: YOU DIDN'T.

00:07:19.586 --> 00:07:21.121
Kikuoka: YES, WE DID.

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:24.891
WE PUT NEWBORNS INTO THE S.T.L.
AND COPIED THEIR SOULS.

00:07:24.957 --> 00:07:26.126
( both gasp )

00:07:26.193 --> 00:07:27.860
Rinko: THESE COPIES
ARE ESSENTIALLY HUMAN,

00:07:27.927 --> 00:07:30.397
SO HOW WOULD YOU RAISE THEM?
NOT IN A VOID.

00:07:30.463 --> 00:07:32.665
YOU'D NEED AN EXACT COPY
OF THE REAL WORLD.

00:07:32.732 --> 00:07:35.335
Kikuoka: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WE CAN'T DO THAT YET,

00:07:35.402 --> 00:07:38.538
SO WE WENT LOOKING
FOR AN ALTERNATIVE,

00:07:38.605 --> 00:07:40.707
AND WE FOUND IT ONLINE.

00:07:40.773 --> 00:07:43.076
Asuna: VRMMO WORLDS.

00:07:43.143 --> 00:07:44.277
Higa: DANG, YOU'RE SHARP.

00:07:44.344 --> 00:07:47.047
USING THE SEED,
WE MADE OUR OWN WORLD,

00:07:47.114 --> 00:07:49.416
WITH VILLAGES AND TERRAIN,
AND CONVERTED IT

00:07:49.482 --> 00:07:52.052
TO MNEMONIC VISUALS
FOR THE S.T.L.

00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:53.720
Kikuoka: WE PLACED
FOUR OF OUR STAFF

00:07:53.786 --> 00:07:55.422
IN THE FIRST VILLAGE WE CREATED.

00:07:55.488 --> 00:07:58.391
THEY ACTED AS PARENTS
TO 16 A.I. INFANTS,

00:07:58.458 --> 00:07:59.526
OR SOUL ARCHETYPES,

00:07:59.592 --> 00:08:01.661
AND RAISED THEM
'TIL THEY WERE 18.

00:08:02.995 --> 00:08:05.732
WE MONITORED THE YOUNGSTERS
AS THEY GREW UP.

00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:07.067
OH, BY THE WAY,

00:08:07.134 --> 00:08:09.736
OFFICIALLY, WE CALL THEM
ARTIFICIAL FLUCTLIGHTS.

00:08:09.802 --> 00:08:11.904
ANYWAY, WE WERE
MORE THAN SATISFIED

00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:13.373
WITH HOW THEY TURNED OUT.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.076
THEY WERE SHARP,
OBEDIENT, AND UPSTANDING.

00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:19.912
WHEN THEY EVENTUALLY PAIRED UP,
WE MADE THEM PARENTS

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:23.050
AND GAVE THEM
NEW SOUL ARCHETYPES TO RAISE.

00:08:23.116 --> 00:08:24.151
OUR STAFF WAS OUT BY THEN,

00:08:24.217 --> 00:08:26.519
SO WE ACCELERATED TIME
BY 5,000,

00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:29.489
AND SOON WE HAD
MULTIPLE GENERATIONS.

00:08:29.556 --> 00:08:32.125
AFTER THREE WEEKS
HAD PASSED IN OUR WORLD,

00:08:32.192 --> 00:08:34.294
300 HAD PASSED IN THEIRS.

00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:36.896
NOW THEY HAVE
A FULLY FUNCTIONING SOCIETY

00:08:36.963 --> 00:08:39.066
WITH A POPULATION OF 80,000.

00:08:39.132 --> 00:08:42.702
Rinko: YOU SIMULATED
AN ENTIRE CIVILIZATION.

00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:43.903
Kikuoka: EXACTLY.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.973
SO FAR, 480 YEARS
HAVE PASSED THERE.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.308
THE CAPITAL, CENTORIA,

00:08:48.375 --> 00:08:50.577
HAS 20,000 CITIZENS
LIVING IN IT.

00:08:50.643 --> 00:08:53.046
Higa: AT THIS POINT,
ALL THE A.I. FLUCTLIGHTS

00:08:53.113 --> 00:08:55.048
HAVE MATURED
INTO THE BOTTOM‐UP A.I. s

00:08:55.115 --> 00:08:56.249
WE WERE SHOOTING FOR.

00:08:56.316 --> 00:08:58.451
WE WERE ALL READY
TO HIT THE NEXT PHASE

00:08:58.518 --> 00:09:01.121
AND WERE STOKED ABOUT IT,
BUT THEN...

00:09:01.188 --> 00:09:03.190
Kikuoka: WE NOTICED
A MAJOR ISSUE

00:09:03.256 --> 00:09:04.657
WHICH STOOD IN OUR WAY.

00:09:04.724 --> 00:09:06.226
Rinko: WHAT ISSUE?

00:09:06.293 --> 00:09:07.627
Kikuoka:
THE GOVERNING BODY THERE,

00:09:07.694 --> 00:09:08.995
CALLED THE AXIOM CHURCH,

00:09:09.062 --> 00:09:11.798
CREATED A SET OF LAWS
CALLED THE TABOO INDEX.

00:09:11.864 --> 00:09:13.366
Asuna: THE WHAT INDEX?

00:09:13.433 --> 00:09:16.136
Kikuoka: THE TABOO INDEX.
IT CONTAINS LAWS

00:09:16.203 --> 00:09:18.571
LIKE ONE FORBIDDING MURDER,
JUST LIKE WE HAVE.

00:09:18.638 --> 00:09:20.807
AND, IF YOU'VE BEEN
WATCHING THE NEWS RECENTLY,

00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:24.111
YOU CAN SEE HOW DIFFICULT
THAT ONE IS FOR HUMANS TO OBEY,

00:09:24.177 --> 00:09:26.946
BUT THE FLUCTLIGHTS OBEY
ALL THEIR LAWS TO THE LETTER.

00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:29.516
THEY'RE OBSESSIVE ABOUT IT.

00:09:29.582 --> 00:09:33.420
THIS TOWN IS BEAUTIFUL,
BUT TOO PERFECT.

00:09:33.486 --> 00:09:34.987
THERE'S NO LITTER
ON THE STREETS

00:09:35.055 --> 00:09:36.289
AND NO CRIME TO SPEAK OF.

00:09:36.356 --> 00:09:38.291
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
THERE'S NOT BEEN

00:09:38.358 --> 00:09:40.660
A SINGLE MURDER
COMMITTED HERE, EITHER.

00:09:40.727 --> 00:09:44.564
Rinko: AND THAT WOULD BE
A GOOD THING, WOULDN'T IT?

00:09:44.631 --> 00:09:47.900
Asuna: IT WOULDN'T,
NOT FOR HIM, ANYWAY.

00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:50.470
HE WANTS A.I. s THAT CAN KILL.

00:09:50.537 --> 00:09:51.638
( Rinko gasps )

00:09:51.704 --> 00:09:54.374
Asuna: KIRITO AND I WERE WRONG.
WE THOUGHT WE KNEW

00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:57.944
WHY YOU WERE INTERESTED
IN VRMMO s, FOR TRAINING.

00:09:58.011 --> 00:09:59.879
WE FIGURED
YOU'D USE THE TECHNOLOGY

00:09:59.946 --> 00:10:02.015
TO TRAIN SOLDIERS AND POLICE.

00:10:02.082 --> 00:10:04.951
BUT FOR AN OFFICER OF THE S.D.F.

00:10:05.018 --> 00:10:07.120
TO ATTEMPT
SOMETHING ON THIS SCALE,

00:10:07.187 --> 00:10:09.056
THERE HAS TO BE MORE AT STAKE,

00:10:09.122 --> 00:10:10.690
AND THERE IS.

00:10:10.757 --> 00:10:14.527
THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT
CREATING A.I. FOR WARFARE,

00:10:14.594 --> 00:10:15.662
ISN'T IT?

00:10:16.963 --> 00:10:20.200
Rinko: IS THAT TRUE, KIKUOKA?

00:10:21.834 --> 00:10:23.203
Kikuoka: FIVE YEARS AGO,

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.174
WHEN THE NERVEGEAR WAS
FIRST ANNOUNCED, I HAD AN IDEA.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.177
ALTHOUGH IT WAS MEANT
FOR GAMING, THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY

00:10:30.243 --> 00:10:33.346
HAD THE POTENTIAL
TO CHANGE HOW WARS WERE FOUGHT.

00:10:33.413 --> 00:10:36.049
WHEN THE S.A.O.
INCIDENT HAPPENED,

00:10:36.116 --> 00:10:38.385
I ASKED TO BE TRANSFERRED
TO THE MINISTRY,

00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:40.553
THEN JOINED
THE TASK FORCE THERE.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.158
THAT WAS ALL SO I COULD GET
THIS PROJECT OFF THE GROUND,

00:10:45.225 --> 00:10:48.928
AND FIVE YEARS LATER,
HERE WE ARE.

00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:50.263
Rinko: THAT'S HIS REASON,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.632
BUT WHY DID YOU DECIDE
TO TAKE PART IN THIS?

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:55.502
Higa: OH. UM,
THAT'S A WHOLE 'NOTHER STORY.

00:10:55.568 --> 00:10:58.471
FOR ME, IT'S PERSONAL.
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

00:10:58.538 --> 00:11:01.008
I HAD A BUD IN KOREA
WHO WAS IN THE ARMY THERE.

00:11:01.074 --> 00:11:03.776
THEN HE GOT KILLED
ON ONE OF HIS TOURS.

00:11:03.843 --> 00:11:06.446
SO I THOUGHT THIS STUPID WORLD

00:11:06.513 --> 00:11:09.116
AIN'T GONNA STOP
HAVIN' WARS ANYTIME SOON.

00:11:09.182 --> 00:11:11.151
BUT IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT
HOW TO HAVE 'EM

00:11:11.218 --> 00:11:13.353
WITHOUT KILLING PEOPLE, THEN...

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.555
( chuckles )
SOUNDS NAÏVE, RIGHT?

00:11:15.622 --> 00:11:18.058
Asuna: YOU DIDN'T
TELL KIRITO ANY OF THIS

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.160
BEFORE YOU HIRED HIM, DID YOU?

00:11:20.227 --> 00:11:21.994
Kikuoka: WOULD IT
MATTER IF I DID?

00:11:22.062 --> 00:11:23.596
Asuna: YES, IT WOULD HAVE.

00:11:23.663 --> 00:11:26.766
IF YOU HAD TOLD HIM, HE NEVER
WOULD HAVE AGREED TO HELP.

00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:30.837
THERE'S ONE IMPORTANT ISSUE
YOUR PLAN DOESN'T EVEN ADDRESS.

00:11:30.903 --> 00:11:31.871
Kikuoka: WHICH IS?

00:11:31.938 --> 00:11:34.407
Asuna: THE RIGHTS OF THE A.I. s.

00:11:34.474 --> 00:11:37.777
THESE THINGS YOU CALL
ARTIFICIAL FLUCTLIGHTS,

00:11:37.844 --> 00:11:40.480
THEY'RE STILL MENTALLY
AND EMOTIONALLY HUMAN.

00:11:40.547 --> 00:11:43.383
Kikuoka: TRUE, BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE THEY HAVE PHYSICAL BODIES.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.419
Asuna: BUT OTHERWISE,
THEY'RE NO DIFFERENT FROM US,

00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:49.156
AND YOU'RE FORCING THEM
TO BE YOUR TOOLS OF WAR.

00:11:49.222 --> 00:11:53.260
KIRITO WOULD NEVER
AGREE TO THAT, EVER.

00:11:53.326 --> 00:11:54.427
Kikuoka: LOOK, I UNDERSTAND

00:11:54.494 --> 00:11:56.396
THE POINT YOU'RE
TRYING TO MAKE HERE.

00:11:56.463 --> 00:12:00.133
BUT, TO ME,
THE LIFE OF ONE S.D.F. SOLDIER

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.170
IS WORTH FAR MORE
THAN 100,000 A.I. s.

00:12:06.473 --> 00:12:09.809
Rinko: ANYWAY, WHY DID YOU
NEED KIRIGAYA FOR THIS?

00:12:09.876 --> 00:12:12.512
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'D USE A CIVILIAN

00:12:12.579 --> 00:12:14.414
ON A PROJECT
THAT'S SO CONFIDENTIAL.

00:12:14.481 --> 00:12:17.450
Kikuoka: I'M SORRY.
I GOT SO CARRIED AWAY

00:12:17.517 --> 00:12:19.786
TALKING ABOUT THE PROJECT,
I ALMOST FORGOT.

00:12:19.852 --> 00:12:22.689
WE NEEDED TO KNOW
WHY THE A.I. FLUCTLIGHTS

00:12:22.755 --> 00:12:25.158
COULDN'T DISOBEY
THE TABOO INDEX,

00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:28.195
SO I CAME UP
WITH AN EXPERIMENT.

00:12:28.261 --> 00:12:30.797
IF WE BLOCKED
A HUMAN'S MEMORIES,

00:12:30.863 --> 00:12:32.065
REVERTED HIM TO CHILDHOOD,

00:12:32.132 --> 00:12:34.701
AND HAD HIM GROW UP
IN OUR VR WORLD,

00:12:34.767 --> 00:12:38.305
WOULD HE BE ABLE
TO DISOBEY THE TABOO INDEX?

00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:40.273
TO CARRY THIS OUT,

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.674
WE NEEDED SOMEONE
WITH EXPERIENCE

00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:43.676
NAVIGATING
IN A VR ENVIRONMENT,

00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:46.413
NOT JUST A WEEK OR
A MONTH'S WORTH OF EXPERIENCE.

00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:47.780
I'M TALKING YEARS.

00:12:47.847 --> 00:12:48.781
( Asuna gasps )

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.752
Kikuoka:
THAT'S WHY I NEEDED HIM.

00:12:54.723 --> 00:12:56.391
Leafa: I CAN'T BELIEVE KAZUTO

00:12:56.458 --> 00:12:59.061
WOULD SIGN UP
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:12:59.128 --> 00:13:00.962
( Silica sighs )
CAN WE EVEN TRUST

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.032
ANYTHING KIKUOKA SAYS ANYMORE?

00:13:03.098 --> 00:13:04.366
Lisbeth: I BET HE ONLY TOLD YOU

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:06.435
A FRACTION
OF WHAT HE'S REALLY UP TO.

00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:07.936
Sinon: I GUESS ALL WE CAN DO NOW

00:13:08.003 --> 00:13:11.640
IS HOPE THE TREATMENT KIRITO
GETS IN THE S.T.L. WILL WORK.

00:13:11.706 --> 00:13:12.807
( Silica sighs )

00:13:12.874 --> 00:13:15.344
Lisbeth: WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THAT TABOO INDEX THING,

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.012
YOU KNOW, THE EXPERIMENT?

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:18.313
DID HE TELL YOU IF IT WORKED?

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.150
Asuna: MM‐HMM.
KIRITO GOT TO BE CLOSE FRIENDS

00:13:21.216 --> 00:13:23.085
WITH TWO OTHERS,
A BOY AND A GIRL.

00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:27.322
KIKUOKA SAID THE GIRL ENDED UP
BREAKING ONE OF THE LAWS.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:30.225
Sinon: REALLY?
DID SHE DO IT BECAUSE OF KIRITO?

00:13:30.292 --> 00:13:31.960
Asuna: UH‐HUH.

00:13:32.027 --> 00:13:33.895
APPARENTLY, SHE VIOLATED A TABOO

00:13:33.962 --> 00:13:37.499
BY TRYING TO ACCESS
A RESTRICTED ADDRESS.

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:39.234
Higa: ACCORDING TO THE LOG,

00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:41.403
THE GIRL SAW
ANOTHER A.I. FLUCTLIGHT

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.005
DIE IN THE RESTRICTED AREA,

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:46.575
AND, FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL,
SHE WAS TRYING TO SAVE HIM.

00:13:46.641 --> 00:13:49.444
Kikuoka: SHE HAD MORE CONCERN
FOR ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE

00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:51.813
THAN SHE HAD
FOR DISOBEYING THE TABOO INDEX.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.750
SHE CHOSE TO DO IT, AND THAT'S
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:13:55.817 --> 00:13:57.919
( girls grumble )

00:13:57.986 --> 00:13:59.754
Silica: THAT'S KIND OF
A NEAT STORY.

00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:02.124
Lisbeth: YEAH, IF ONLY IT WASN'T

00:14:02.191 --> 00:14:03.925
ABOUT TRAINING A.I. s
TO KILL PEOPLE.

00:14:03.992 --> 00:14:07.629
Asuna: YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT LOOK AT WHAT SHE DID.

00:14:07.696 --> 00:14:11.500
SHE WENT AGAINST THE SYSTEM
JUST TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE.

00:14:11.566 --> 00:14:13.702
Leafa: DOES THIS
A.I. GIRL HAVE A NAME?

00:14:13.768 --> 00:14:14.703
Asuna: YES.

00:14:17.206 --> 00:14:18.140
ALICE?

00:14:18.207 --> 00:14:19.408
Kikuoka: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:14:19.474 --> 00:14:21.743
I WAS STUNNED
WHEN I FOUND OUT.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.214
HER HAVING THAT NAME
IS QUITE THE COINCIDENCE.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.548
THE NAME ALICE, YOU SEE,

00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:29.018
ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
THE NAME OF THE CONCEPT

00:14:29.084 --> 00:14:31.953
THAT WAS THE FOUNDATION
FOR RATH AND THIS PROJECT.

00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:33.722
Asuna: CONCEPT?

00:14:33.788 --> 00:14:37.292
Kikuoka: AN A.I. THAT IS
HIGHLY ADAPTIVE AND AUTONOMOUS,

00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:39.861
MORE SPECIFICALLY,
AN ARTIFICIAL

00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:43.332
LABILE INTELLIGENCE
CYBERNATED EXISTENCE,

00:14:43.398 --> 00:14:45.867
OR THE ACRONYM "ALICE."

00:14:45.934 --> 00:14:47.536
OUR GOAL ULTIMATELY

00:14:47.602 --> 00:14:50.872
WAS TO TURN AN A.I. FLUCTLIGHT
INTO AN ALICE.

00:14:52.774 --> 00:14:57.979
THEREFORE, WE CALLED IT
PROJECT ALICIZATION.

00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:01.083
Leafa: THAT SOUNDS
SO COMPLICATED.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.519
Asuna: YEAH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND
A LOT OF WHAT HE SAID, EITHER.

00:15:04.586 --> 00:15:07.522
BUT HE SAID IF THEY
HAD SAVED ALICE'S FLUCTLIGHT,

00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:10.492
THEIR RESEARCH WOULD BE
MUCH FURTHER ALONG BY NOW.

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:12.127
Lisbeth: MM. DID SHE DIE?

00:15:12.194 --> 00:15:13.928
Asuna: NO, SHE'S STILL ALIVE,

00:15:13.995 --> 00:15:17.099
BUT REMEMBER I SAID
TIME THERE'S FASTER THAN HERE?

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.267
Lisbeth: MM‐HMM.

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:20.369
Asuna: WELL,
BY THE TIME THEY NOTICED,

00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:22.304
TWO DAYS HAD GONE BY THERE.

00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:23.938
SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CAPITAL,

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:26.641
AND THE AXIOM CHURCH
HAD HER FLUCTLIGHT ALTERED.

00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:28.477
Sinon: THEY CHANGED HER SOUL?

00:15:28.543 --> 00:15:30.479
HOW COULD THEY
GIVE A.I. FLUCTLIGHTS

00:15:30.545 --> 00:15:32.414
THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY
OVER EACH OTHER?

00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:35.317
Asuna: THEY DON'T
REALLY KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED,

00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:38.120
BUT THEY THINK IT MIGHT BE
A SYSTEM EXPLOIT.

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:39.754
A FEW OF THE A.I. FLUCTLIGHTS

00:15:39.821 --> 00:15:41.956
CAN USE
WHAT THEY CALL "SACRED ARTS."

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.093
THEY'RE BASICALLY
SYSTEM ACCESS AUTHORITIES

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:46.095
THAT LOOK LIKE MAGIC SPELLS.
