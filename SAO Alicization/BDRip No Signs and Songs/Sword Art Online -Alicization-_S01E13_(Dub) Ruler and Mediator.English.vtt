WEBVTT

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:04.336
Cardinal: UNDER THE ALL‐POWERFUL
ADMINISTRATOR'S RULE,

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:07.339
THIS WORLD ENTERED
A LONG PERIOD OF PEACE,

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.308
AND THE PEOPLE BECAME APATHETIC.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:15.114
70 YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE
QUINELLA BECAME ADMINISTRATOR.

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:17.983
THEN, ONE DAY,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.020
SHE REALIZED
SHE'D UNDERGONE A CHANGE.

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:26.526
SHE USED HER CONTROL COMMAND

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:29.294
TO EXAMINE HER FLUCTLIGHT
AND DISCOVERED

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:32.698
IT HAD REACHED ITS CAPACITY
TO RETAIN HER MEMORIES.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.602
SHE REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT,

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:40.305
SO SHE CAME UP WITH
ANOTHER MONSTROUS SOLUTION.

00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:42.608
Administrator: WELCOME, CHILD.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.911
PLEASE, COME CLOSER.

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:47.613
Girl: YES, MA'AM.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.415
Administrator: IF I CAN
OVERWRITE HER FLUCTLIGHT

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:53.953
WITH A COPY OF THE THOUGHTS
AND MEMORIES FROM MY OWN,

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.988
I WILL NEVER LOSE THEM.

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:57.657
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.492
( girl whimpers )

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.129
Cardinal: IT WAS
A DIABOLICAL CEREMONY...

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:07.533
A FUSING OF SOUL AND MEMORY

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.902
WHICH SHE CALLED
THE SYNTHESIS RITUAL.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.107
WITH IT, SHE COULD SEIZE CONTROL
OF ANOTHER HUMAN'S FLUCTLIGHT.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:18.243
AND HERE WAS
WHERE ADMINISTRATOR,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.881
OR QUINELLA,
MADE A CRITICAL MISTAKE.

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.415
Kirito: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:26.218
Cardinal: IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO HER
THAT, DURING THE PROCESS

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:29.254
OF TAKING OVER THE YOUNG GIRL
AND DELETING HER OLD SELF,

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:30.890
THERE WOULD BE A SPLIT SECOND

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:34.860
WHERE TWO GODS WITH EQUAL POWER
EXISTED AT THE SAME TIME.

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:37.329
KIRITO, YOU ARE FAMILIAR

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.431
WITH MY ORIGINAL VERSION,
ARE YOU NOT?

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:42.968
WHAT IS THE MAIN FEATURE
OF THE CARDINAL SYSTEM?

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.037
Kirito: OH, UM...

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:47.106
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO OPERATE AUTOMATICALLY

00:01:47.172 --> 00:01:48.841
FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:50.342
IT DOESN'T NEED HUMANS TO RUN.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.178
Cardinal: THAT IS CORRECT,
AND, TO FACILITATE IT,

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.781
THE CARDINAL SYSTEM
HAS TWO CORE PROGRAMS,

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:58.050
A MAIN PROCESS AND A SUBPROCESS.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.486
THE MAIN PROCESS PERFORMS
BALANCE CONTROLS ON THE SYSTEM.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:05.157
Kirito: WHILE THE SUBPROCESS
RUNS ERROR CHECKS ON THE MAIN.

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:06.659
Cardinal: PRECISELY.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:10.095
WHEN SHE BECAME ADMINISTRATOR,
THE PRESERVATION OF ORDER

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:13.498
WASN'T THE ONLY THING QUINELLA
ETCHED ONTO HER FLUCTLIGHT.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.335
IN THE RECESSES OF HER SOUL,

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:20.205
I STILL FUNCTIONED
AS THE SUBPROCESS TO HER MAIN,

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:22.975
AND I WAS OBLIGATED
TO CORRECT HER ERRORS.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.810
( Kirito gasps )

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.947
Cardinal: FOR 70 LONG YEARS,

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:30.482
I WAITED FOR MY OPPORTUNITY...

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:34.787
AND FINALLY IT HAD ARRIVED!

00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:13.867
Administrator: IT WORKED.

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:16.870
THIS LITTLE GIRL'S FLUCTLIGHT
IS MINE NOW.

00:04:16.937 --> 00:04:19.172
‐ Cardinal: SYSTEM CALL.
‐ ( Administrator gasps )

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.975
Cardinal:
GENERATE LUMINOUS ELEMENT.

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:25.045
LIGHTNING SHAPE. DISCHARGE!

00:04:25.112 --> 00:04:26.547
Administrator: WHAT?

00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:29.650
Cardinal: SYSTEM CALL!

00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:33.053
GENERATE LUMINOUS ELEMENT!

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.354
Administrator: SYSTEM CALL!

00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:37.357
GENERATE UMBRA ELEMENT.
BALL SHAPE!

00:04:37.424 --> 00:04:39.292
Both: DISCHARGE!

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:44.732
Administrator: SYSTEM CALL!
REDEFINE OBJECT!

00:04:46.967 --> 00:04:48.101
SWORD CLASS!

00:04:48.168 --> 00:04:50.203
Cardinal: SYSTEM CALL.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.673
REDEFINE OBJECT!

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.541
ROD CLASS!

00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:55.342
Administrator: SYSTEM CALL!

00:04:55.408 --> 00:04:58.579
CHANGE FIELD ATTRIBUTE!

00:05:00.113 --> 00:05:01.414
Cardinal: NO!

00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:05.886
SHE MADE THIS AREA OFF‐LIMITS
FOR SYSTEM COMMANDS.

00:05:05.953 --> 00:05:07.287
‐ ( Administrator grunts )
‐ ( Cardinal grunts )

00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:22.770
I CAN'T DEFEAT HER
IN THIS BODY.

00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:25.005
( gasps )

00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:27.775
( staff rings clinking )

00:05:34.582 --> 00:05:35.983
( Administrator gasps )

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:37.918
Cardinal: SYSTEM CALL!

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:39.887
GENERATE AERIAL ELEMENT!

00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:41.622
STREAM SHAPE!

00:05:43.957 --> 00:05:46.660
( narrating ) THERE ARE ONLY
TWO LOCATIONS IN THIS WORLD

00:05:46.727 --> 00:05:48.929
WHICH ADMINISTRATOR
HAS NO CONTROL OVER.

00:05:50.063 --> 00:05:53.166
ONE IS THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE END MOUNTAINS.

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:55.335
THE OTHER IS...

00:05:58.105 --> 00:06:00.307
SYSTEM CALL!

00:06:00.373 --> 00:06:01.775
GENERATE BLIZZARD GATE.

00:06:01.842 --> 00:06:03.310
ZERO ONE!

00:06:05.513 --> 00:06:06.947
( narrating )
...THE GREAT LIBRARY!

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.084
IN AN INSTANT,

00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:15.288
THIS SPACE WAS COMPLETELY
ISOLATED FROM THE OUTSIDE.

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:20.060
FOR THE PAST 200 YEARS,
I'VE BEEN WATCHING AND PLOTTING.

00:06:20.127 --> 00:06:21.995
I WAITED FOR THE PERFECT MOMENT

00:06:22.062 --> 00:06:25.098
WHEN I COULD CATCH HER
OFF GUARD, THEN AMBUSH HER.

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.035
SHE KNEW WHAT I WAS UP TO

00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:29.770
AND WAS CONSTANTLY ON GUARD,

00:06:29.837 --> 00:06:34.374
SO SHE CREATED POWERFUL AND
LOYAL SERVANTS FOR PROTECTION.

00:06:34.441 --> 00:06:36.810
Administrator:
THROUGH THE SYNTHESIS RITUAL,

00:06:36.877 --> 00:06:42.916
THIS MAN WILL BE REBORN
AS A WARRIOR DEVOTED ONLY TO ME,

00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:45.318
MY INTEGRITY KNIGHT!

00:06:45.385 --> 00:06:46.854
( chorus vocalizing )

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.723
Cardinal: THE FIRST ONE SHE
TURNED INTO AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.391
WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL SWORDSMAN

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:53.426
WHO HATED
THE RULE OF THE CHURCH.

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:55.629
SEEKING REFUGE FROM IT,

00:06:55.696 --> 00:06:59.432
HE AND HIS COMPANIONS FOUNDED
A VILLAGE IN THE OUTER REGIONS.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.035
THE NAME OF THIS KNIGHT

00:07:02.102 --> 00:07:04.705
WAS BERCOULI SYNTHESIS ONE.

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:10.077
ONE‐ON‐ONE, ADMINISTRATOR AND I
ARE EQUALLY MATCHED.

00:07:10.143 --> 00:07:11.478
AT LEAST, WE WERE.

00:07:11.545 --> 00:07:13.881
HER KNIGHTS
ARE FAST AND POWERFUL.

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:17.250
THEY MADE THE PROSPECT
OF AMBUSHING HER IMPOSSIBLE,

00:07:17.317 --> 00:07:20.053
SO, AT THE RISK
OF BEING SPOTTED,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.822
I SOUGHT OUT MY OWN ALLIES.

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.692
I OPENED DOORWAYS
FAR FROM THE CATHEDRAL,

00:07:24.758 --> 00:07:26.627
THEN CAST
SENSORY SHARING SPELLS

00:07:26.694 --> 00:07:29.296
UPON BIRDS AND INSECTS
AND SENT THEM OUT

00:07:29.362 --> 00:07:32.199
TO LEAD POTENTIAL ALLIES
BACK HERE TO ME.

00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:33.200
( chuckles )

00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:34.401
Kirito: UH...

00:07:35.536 --> 00:07:37.170
HUH? ( gasps )

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.440
Cardinal: LOOK HERE.

00:07:41.341 --> 00:07:42.475
MEET CHARLOTTE.

00:07:42.543 --> 00:07:44.645
SHE SPOTTED
YOU AND EUGEO IN RULID

00:07:44.712 --> 00:07:46.614
AND HAS BEEN
TAGGING ALONG WITH YOU

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.281
EVER SINCE YOU LEFT THAT PLACE.

00:07:48.348 --> 00:07:52.185
SOMETIMES SHE DID MORE
THAN JUST TAG ALONG.

00:07:52.252 --> 00:07:53.120
( Kirito gasps )

00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:55.488
SHE WAS THE ONE GUIDING ME

00:07:55.556 --> 00:07:57.257
WHEN WE WERE RUNNING
FROM THAT KNIGHT.

00:07:57.324 --> 00:07:59.627
HUH! SNEAKY.

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:02.362
SO BACK WHEN MY ZEPHILIAS
GOT CHOPPED UP,

00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:04.798
WAS THAT YOU
GIVING ME THE PEP TALK?

00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:06.600
UH...

00:08:06.667 --> 00:08:08.335
Cardinal: SHE'S A SHY ONE.

00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:10.137
OF ALL MY OBSERVATION UNITS,

00:08:10.203 --> 00:08:13.674
CHARLOTTE HAS BEEN OUT SEARCHING
LONGER THAN THE OTHERS.

00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:15.576
AT LAST, SHE CAN REST NOW.

00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:17.477
HER MISSION'S COME TO AN END.

00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:19.513
WHEN I ENLISTED HER,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.516
I FROZE THE NATURAL DEGRADATION
OF HER LIFE.

00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:24.618
THAT WAS OVER 200 YEARS AGO.

00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:27.187
( Kirito sighs )
THANKS, CHARLOTTE.

00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:30.023
SO, FOR 200 YEARS,

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.561
YOU HAD CRITTERS LIKE HER OUT
IN THE WORLD LOOKING FOR HELP,

00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:36.496
AND YOU'VE BEEN STUCK
IN HERE THE WHOLE TIME?

00:08:36.564 --> 00:08:38.832
Cardinal: INDEED,
AND, AS I SAT HERE

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:41.068
OBSERVING THE WORLD
THROUGH THEIR EYES,

00:08:41.134 --> 00:08:42.703
A QUESTION KEPT REPEATING.

00:08:43.804 --> 00:08:45.639
WHY WOULD THE GODS
OF THE OUTSIDE

00:08:45.706 --> 00:08:47.340
ABANDON A WORLD THEY CREATED

00:08:47.407 --> 00:08:51.779
TO SUFFER UNDER THE TYRANNY
OF ADMINISTRATOR, A FALSE GOD?

00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:55.616
AS I PONDERED THIS AND REFERRED
TO THE CARDINAL SYSTEM'S

00:08:55.683 --> 00:08:57.751
BUILT‐IN DATABASE OVER AND OVER,

00:08:57.818 --> 00:09:01.121
I EVENTUALLY ARRIVED
AT A CONCLUSION.

00:09:01.188 --> 00:09:03.123
RATH MAY BE THE GOD HERE,

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.060
BUT IT DOESN'T WANT THE PEOPLE
TO LEAD HAPPY LIVES AT ALL.

00:09:07.127 --> 00:09:09.429
IT WANTS THE OPPOSITE.

00:09:09.496 --> 00:09:10.864
THIS IS A TEST.

00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:14.436
RATH CREATED THE UNDERWORLD

00:09:14.504 --> 00:09:16.806
SO THEY CAN OBSERVE
HOW ITS PEOPLE REACT

00:09:16.872 --> 00:09:19.374
TO STRESS PARAMETERS
PUT UPON THEM.

00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:22.277
DAY BY DAY, THEY INCREASE.

00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:25.214
EVENTUALLY ALL THOSE STRESSORS
WILL REACH THEIR LIMIT,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.217
AND THE FINAL PHASE OF THE TEST
WILL BE AT HAND.

00:09:28.283 --> 00:09:29.451
Kirito: THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.821
Cardinal: WHAT THESE PEOPLE
FEAR THE MOST,

00:09:31.887 --> 00:09:33.989
AN INVASION
FROM OUTSIDE THIS REALM.

00:09:34.857 --> 00:09:36.291
Kirito: THE DARK TERRITORY.

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:40.095
Cardinal: CORRECT. THE WORLD
OF DARKNESS WAS CREATED

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:44.667
TO SUBJECT THE UNDERWORLDIANS
TO THE ULTIMATE AGONY.

00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:47.937
THE MONSTERS THERE HAVE
FLUCTLIGHTS, JUST LIKE HUMANS.

00:09:48.003 --> 00:09:50.305
THE DIFFERENCE IS,
THEIR PRIME DIRECTIVE

00:09:50.372 --> 00:09:53.609
IS TO PLUNDER AND SLAUGHTER.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:54.944
THEY'RE EAGER FOR THE DAY

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.312
WHEN THEY CAN BREACH
THE LAND OF THE IUMS,

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:00.149
AS THEY CALL YOU,
AND WREAK HAVOC.

00:10:00.215 --> 00:10:01.483
THAT DAY IS COMING.

00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:05.688
Kirito: AND ADMINISTRATOR,
DOES SHE KNOW THEY'RE COMING?

00:10:05.755 --> 00:10:08.157
Cardinal: YES,
BUT SHE UNDERESTIMATES THEM.

00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:10.392
SHE THINKS SHE
AND HER INTEGRITY KNIGHTS

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:12.094
ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO REPEL THEM.

00:10:12.161 --> 00:10:15.264
SHE EVEN HAD
ALL FOUR GUARDIAN DRAGONS SLAIN,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.533
NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, AND WEST.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.935
AS ALLIES,
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN VALUABLE,

00:10:20.002 --> 00:10:22.471
BUT SHE COULD NOT CONTROL THEM.

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:24.507
PITY, SHE CANNOT WIN NOW,

00:10:24.574 --> 00:10:26.942
FOR THE FORCES OF DARKNESS
ARE TOO MANY,

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:28.878
AND HER NUMBERS ARE TOO FEW.

00:10:28.944 --> 00:10:31.480
Kirito: HANG ON. IF THAT'S TRUE,

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.182
THEN WHY BOTHER TAKIN' HER DOWN?

00:10:33.248 --> 00:10:35.718
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE
THE FATE OF THIS WORLD'S SEALED

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:37.152
WHETHER YOU DO OR DON'T.

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:39.221
Cardinal: YOU ARE CORRECT.

00:10:39.288 --> 00:10:40.289
( Kirito gasps )

00:10:40.355 --> 00:10:41.591
Cardinal: NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:44.560
THE DARK TERRITORY
WILL INVADE THE HUMAN REALM,

00:10:44.627 --> 00:10:46.295
AND THERE IS NO STOPPING IT.

00:10:46.361 --> 00:10:49.565
Kirito: SO, LIKE,
ONCE YOU STOP ADMINISTRATOR,

00:10:49.632 --> 00:10:51.033
YOUR JOB HERE'S DONE,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.202
AND WHATEVER ELSE HAPPENS
HAPPENS.

00:10:53.268 --> 00:10:55.905
YOU DON'T CARE, DO YOU?

00:10:57.673 --> 00:10:59.274
Cardinal: PERHAPS I DON'T.

00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:02.712
HOWEVER...

00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:06.949
RATH ENGINEERED
THE BLOODSHED THAT IS TO COME.

00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:09.084
I CANNOT ACCEPT
A GOD WHO DOES THAT.

00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:14.223
ONCE I LEARNED THE LOAD TEST
WAS UNAVOIDABLE, I DECIDED.

00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:19.562
THE HUMAN REALM
AND THE DARK TERRITORY

00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:21.631
MUST BE RETURNED TO NOTHINGNESS.

00:11:21.697 --> 00:11:23.666
Kirito: HOLD UP. DECIDED?

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:25.300
Cardinal: THAT IS WHAT I SAID.

00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:27.069
WHEN I REGAIN CONTROL,

00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:30.773
I WILL ACCESS THE FLUCTLIGHTS
STORED IN THE LIGHTCUBE CLUSTER.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.975
THEN I WILL DELETE
EVERY RESIDENT

00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:35.678
OF THE REALMS
OF HUMANITY AND DARKNESS.

00:11:35.745 --> 00:11:37.246
‐ ( Kirito shudders )
‐ Cardinal: THAT SAID,

00:11:37.312 --> 00:11:41.316
IF YOU DECIDE TO HELP ME
AND I ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATOR,

00:11:41.383 --> 00:11:44.820
I WILL HAVE FULL ACCESS
TO ALL OF MY AUTHORITY.

00:11:44.887 --> 00:11:47.289
THEN, BEFORE I
EXTINGUISH THIS WORLD,

00:11:47.356 --> 00:11:49.258
I CAN GRANT YOU ONE WISH,

00:11:49.324 --> 00:11:51.126
TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, ANYWAY.

00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:54.163
IF YOU SINGLE OUT
THOSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAVE,

00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:57.032
I WILL REFRAIN
FROM DELETING THEIR FLUCTLIGHTS.

00:11:57.099 --> 00:12:00.002
‐ INSTEAD, I WILL ARCHIVE THEM.
‐ ( Kirito gasps )

00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:02.404
Cardinal: AFTER YOU ESCAPE
TO THE REAL WORLD,

00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:05.107
YOU CAN SAVE THEIR LIGHTCUBES.

00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:08.678
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO SET ASIDE TEN OR SO.

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:10.713
( Kirito gasps )

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.116
I GOTTA PICK?

00:12:14.183 --> 00:12:16.051
WAIT A SEC.

00:12:16.118 --> 00:12:18.253
SOMETHING DOESN'T ADD UP HERE.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.823
YOU SAID YOUR SOUL'S
A COPY OF HERS.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.958
THAT MEANS
YOU GOT THE SELFISH PART

00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:25.194
OF THE NOBILITY IN YOU, TOO,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.164
THE DRIVE TO PUT YOUR WANTS
AND NEEDS ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE'S.

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:34.236
SO WHY'D YOU WAIT HERE ALL
BY YOURSELF AND FOR 200 YEARS?

00:12:34.303 --> 00:12:37.472
YOU COULD HAVE FOUND A PLACE
FAR AWAY FROM ADMINISTRATOR

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.241
AND HAD SOME KINDA LIFE.

00:12:39.308 --> 00:12:40.309
( Cardinal sighs )

00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:43.245
THE CARDINAL SUBPROCESS
WAS BURNED INTO ME.

00:12:43.312 --> 00:12:46.982
THAT MEANS MY CORE DESIRES
AMOUNT TO ONLY ONE THING,

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:51.220
TO ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATOR AND
RESTORE NORMAL FUNCTION HERE.

00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:54.757
TO ME, THERE IS NO WAY TO HAVE
A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING WORLD,

00:12:54.824 --> 00:12:56.859
UNLESS THE CORRUPTING ELEMENT
IS DEALT WITH

00:12:56.926 --> 00:12:58.994
AND THE SLATE WIPED CLEAN.

00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:01.330
ACTUALLY, ON SECOND THOUGHT...

00:13:01.396 --> 00:13:03.065
( Kirito sighs )

00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:04.600
Cardinal: PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:07.036
I DO HARBOR ONE DESIRE,

00:13:07.102 --> 00:13:09.104
SOMETHING I WAS
DESPERATE TO EXPERIENCE

00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:13.008
JUST ONCE
FOR THE LAST 200 YEARS.

00:13:14.744 --> 00:13:17.146
KIRITO,
WOULD YOU STAND UP, PLEASE?

00:13:17.212 --> 00:13:18.180
Kirito: UH...

00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:22.618
( Cardinal groans )

00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:24.453
Kirito: UH...

00:13:27.757 --> 00:13:29.158
Cardinal: THIS SHOULD DO.

00:13:29.224 --> 00:13:31.493
ALL RIGHT, PLEASE STEP FORWARD.

00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:35.765
‐ COME CLOSER.
‐ Kirito: WHY?

00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:37.967
Cardinal: DON'T ARGUE WITH ME!

00:13:40.803 --> 00:13:42.371
RAISE YOUR ARMS, PLEASE.

00:13:42.437 --> 00:13:43.372
Kirito: LIKE THIS?

00:13:43.438 --> 00:13:44.507
Cardinal: IN FRONT OF YOU,

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:45.808
AND MAKE A CIRCLE WITH THEM.

00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:47.009
Kirito: UH...

00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:51.413
Cardinal: HONESTLY,
HOW DENSE ARE YOU?

00:13:58.954 --> 00:14:01.456
SO THIS IS IT.

00:14:01.524 --> 00:14:03.693
NOW I SEE.

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:05.828
THIS IS
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN.

00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:07.296
( Kirito grunts )

00:14:08.964 --> 00:14:10.533
( Cardinal gasps )

00:14:12.502 --> 00:14:13.669
TO BE HELD,

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:16.506
IT'S SO WARM AND COMFORTING.

00:14:16.572 --> 00:14:20.876
AFTER 200 YEARS,
THIS MAKES THE WAIT WORTH IT.

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:25.147
TO THINK SOMETHING SO SIMPLE
COULD BE SO SATISFYING.

00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:28.417
THE WAIT
WAS MORE THAN WORTH IT.

00:14:31.654 --> 00:14:32.588
‐ ( robe flaps )
‐ ( Kirito gasps )

00:14:37.827 --> 00:14:38.961
Cardinal: HMM?

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:41.897
WELL? HOW LONG ARE YOU PLANNING

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:43.599
TO STAND THERE LIKE THAT?

00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:45.367
Kirito: SORRY. JUST BEIN' HUMAN!

00:14:45.434 --> 00:14:48.437
Cardinal: SO THEN,
WHAT'S YOUR DECISION?

00:14:48.504 --> 00:14:49.939
Kirito: UH...

00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:52.975
Cardinal: WILL YOU HELP ME
STOP ADMINISTRATOR OR NOT?

00:14:53.042 --> 00:14:54.610
( Kirito sighs )

00:14:54.677 --> 00:14:56.045
YEAH, OKAY.

00:14:56.111 --> 00:14:59.248
I'LL HELP YOU WITH THIS PLAN
OF YOURS, SORT OF.

00:14:59.314 --> 00:15:00.550
Cardinal: HUH?

00:15:00.616 --> 00:15:03.953
Kirito: LOOK, I GET WHERE
YOU'RE COMING FROM AND ALL,

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:06.088
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP
ON THIS WORLD,

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:08.791
AND I WON'T GIVE UP
ON ITS PEOPLE.

00:15:08.858 --> 00:15:12.862
I'LL HELP YOU, BUT I'LL STILL
TRY AND FIND A WAY TO SAVE 'EM.

00:15:12.928 --> 00:15:15.865
Cardinal: HONESTLY,
YOUR OPTIMISM IS ABSURD.

00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:17.432
Kirito: MAYBE SO,

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:20.369
BUT IF EVERYTHING GETS DELETED,
SO DO YOU.

00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:21.571
( Cardinal gasps )

00:15:21.637 --> 00:15:23.839
Kirito: IF I CAN'T
FIGURE THIS OUT, YOU CAN BET

00:15:23.906 --> 00:15:27.042
YOU'LL BE ONE OF THE TEN PEOPLE
I'M GONNA WANT SAVED.

00:15:27.109 --> 00:15:28.043
( Cardinal sighs )

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.245
COULD YOU BE ANY MORE FOOLISH?

00:15:30.312 --> 00:15:32.815
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO EXTINGUISH THIS WORLD

00:15:32.882 --> 00:15:35.217
IF I AM NOT PRESENT
TO PERFORM THE TASK?

00:15:35.284 --> 00:15:37.887
Kirito: DON'T KNOW.
HEY, I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU SAY,

00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:39.321
BUT I'M GONNA TRY TO COME UP

00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:41.456
WITH A BETTER SOLUTION
ALL THE SAME.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.225
( Cardinal groans )

00:15:43.292 --> 00:15:48.898
SOMEDAY, YOU, TOO, WILL KNOW
THE BITTERNESS OF RESIGNATION.

00:15:48.964 --> 00:15:51.801
IT IS NOT THE SAME
AS TRYING AND FAILING.

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:55.237
IT IS BEING FORCED
TO ADMIT FAILURE,

00:15:55.304 --> 00:15:58.541
REGARDLESS OF HOW HARD YOU TRY.

00:16:03.915 --> 00:16:05.650
( footsteps approaching )

00:16:05.717 --> 00:16:06.651
( Eugeo sighs )

00:16:06.718 --> 00:16:08.520
Kirito: THERE YOU ARE!

00:16:08.586 --> 00:16:10.287
WE THOUGHT
YOU WERE STILL IN THE BATH.

00:16:10.354 --> 00:16:13.591
Eugeo: I'M SORRY.
I GUESS I LOST TRACK OF TIME.

00:16:13.658 --> 00:16:16.961
Kirito: SO, UH,
CARDINAL AND I WERE TALKIN'.

00:16:17.028 --> 00:16:20.164
SHE USED TO BE THE‐‐
THE PONTIFEX HERE

00:16:20.231 --> 00:16:22.967
'TIL ADMINISTRATOR KICKED
HER OUT AND TOOK OVER HER JOB.

00:16:23.034 --> 00:16:24.335
Eugeo: YOU WERE A PONTIFEX?

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.237
Kirito: DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S ON OUR SIDE.

00:16:26.303 --> 00:16:28.840
SHE'S GONNA HELP US FIGHT
THE INTEGRITY KNIGHTS.

00:16:28.906 --> 00:16:30.908
‐ Eugeo: Y‐YOU WILL?
‐ Kirito: YEAH.

00:16:30.975 --> 00:16:33.344
SHE WANTS TO GET HER TITLE
AS PONTIFEX BACK,

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.579
BUT TO DO THAT,

00:16:34.646 --> 00:16:37.081
SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO TAKE DOWN
ADMINISTRATOR FIRST,

00:16:37.148 --> 00:16:40.652
SO, LIKE, SHE SORT OF
SUGGESTED WE JOIN FORCES.

00:16:40.718 --> 00:16:41.653
Cardinal: MM‐HMM.

00:16:41.719 --> 00:16:43.320
Eugeo: THERE'S THIS GIRL,

00:16:43.387 --> 00:16:46.357
AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT
CALLED ALICE SYNTHESIS THIRTY.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:49.961
I THINK SHE'S THE SAME PERSON
AS AN ALICE ZUBERG FROM RULID.

00:16:50.027 --> 00:16:51.328
DO YOU KNOW IF SHE IS?

00:16:51.395 --> 00:16:53.565
Cardinal: I'M SORRY,
BUT THE INFORMATION

00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:56.534
I'M ABLE TO ACCESS HERE
IS EXTREMELY LIMITED.

00:16:56.601 --> 00:17:00.672
I KNOW INTEGRITY KNIGHT ALICE
WAS BORN, BUT NO OTHER DETAILS.

00:17:00.738 --> 00:17:05.242
HOWEVER, I CAN TELL YOU HOW
TO UNDO THE SYNTHESIS RITUAL,

00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:08.045
THE SACRED ART
THAT CREATES INTEGRITY KNIGHTS.

00:17:08.112 --> 00:17:10.582
( Eugeo gasps )
AND HOW DO I DO THAT?

00:17:10.648 --> 00:17:13.050
Cardinal: SIMPLY REMOVE
THE PIETY MODULE.

00:17:13.117 --> 00:17:15.286
ALL THE KNIGHTS HAVE ONE
IN THEIR FOREHEAD.

00:17:15.352 --> 00:17:17.622
IT LOOKS LIKE
A TRIANGULAR PRISM.

00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:20.057
( Eugeo gasps ) WE SAW ONE.

00:17:20.124 --> 00:17:23.227
Cardinal: ONCE THE PIETY MODULE
IS INSERTED,

00:17:23.294 --> 00:17:25.930
IT EFFECTIVELY BLOCKS
THE LINKS TO MEMORIES.

00:17:25.997 --> 00:17:29.634
WITH THAT, THE PROSPECTIVE
KNIGHT'S PAST IS SEALED AWAY‐‐

00:17:29.701 --> 00:17:33.004
THE RESULT, A KNIGHT
WHO IS LOYAL TO THE CHURCH

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.239
AND TO THEIR CREATOR,
THE PONTIFEX.

00:17:35.306 --> 00:17:37.441
Kirito: WE ALMOST BROKE
THE SPELL ON ONE OF 'EM.

00:17:37.509 --> 00:17:39.744
WE REMINDED HIM
OF WHO HE USED TO BE,

00:17:39.811 --> 00:17:41.045
AND THE CRYSTAL POPPED OUT.

00:17:41.112 --> 00:17:43.314
Cardinal: THAT IS NOT ENOUGH
TO FREE A KNIGHT.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.317
ANOTHER ELEMENT IS REQUIRED
IN ORDER TO BREAK THE SPELL.

00:17:46.383 --> 00:17:48.385
Eugeo: AND? WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

00:17:48.452 --> 00:17:50.387
Cardinal: THE THING
THAT ONCE EXISTED

00:17:50.454 --> 00:17:53.257
IN THE PLACE
WHERE THE MODULE WAS INSERTED,

00:17:53.324 --> 00:17:56.127
OR, MORE SPECIFICALLY,
A MEMORY FRAGMENT,

00:17:56.193 --> 00:17:58.495
ONE THE INTEGRITY KNIGHT
TREASURES THE MOST.

00:17:58.563 --> 00:18:01.633
ADMINISTRATOR IS
A CAUTIOUS WOMAN.

00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:03.200
I DON'T DOUBT SHE KEEPS

00:18:03.267 --> 00:18:05.402
ALL THE MEMORY FRAGMENTS
CLOSE AT HAND.

00:18:05.469 --> 00:18:07.672
IF ANYWHERE,
THEY'D BE IN HER CHAMBER,

00:18:07.739 --> 00:18:12.143
LOCATED ON THE TOP FLOOR
OF THE CENTRAL CATHEDRAL.

00:18:12.209 --> 00:18:14.646
Kirito: OKAY,
SO TO TURN THE KNIGHTS

00:18:14.712 --> 00:18:16.113
BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE,

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.916
WE NEED TO GET OUR HANDS
ON THEIR MEMORY FRAGMENTS.

00:18:18.983 --> 00:18:20.484
BUT I DOUBT
THE INTEGRITY KNIGHTS

00:18:20.552 --> 00:18:23.287
ARE JUST GONNA LET US
WALK UP TO ADMINISTRATOR'S ROOM.

00:18:23.354 --> 00:18:25.489
I BET WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIGHT EVERY ONE OF 'EM

00:18:25.557 --> 00:18:27.358
ALL THE WAY
TO THE TOP OF THE CATHEDRAL.

00:18:27.424 --> 00:18:29.393
Cardinal: DON'T BE NAIVE.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.462
AN INTEGRITY KNIGHT
DOES NOT STOP

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:33.831
UNTIL EITHER YOU
OR THEY ARE DEAD.

00:18:33.898 --> 00:18:37.334
I CAN HELP YOU GET EQUIPMENT
THAT IS EQUAL TO THEIRS,

00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:40.337
BUT THAT IS
ALL THE ASSISTANCE I CAN OFFER.

00:18:40.404 --> 00:18:42.507
THE REST WILL BE
UP TO YOUR SKILLS

00:18:42.574 --> 00:18:45.076
AND WHETHER YOU HAVE
THE STAMINA TO ENDURE.

00:18:45.142 --> 00:18:48.445
Eugeo: IF ALICE SHOWS UP
AND I HAVE TO FIGHT HER,

00:18:48.513 --> 00:18:50.181
I‐I DON'T WANT TO HURT HER.

00:18:50.247 --> 00:18:51.683
I CAN'T.

00:18:51.749 --> 00:18:55.019
I JUST WANT TO TAKE HER
BACK TO OUR VILLAGE.

00:18:55.086 --> 00:18:56.888
Cardinal: I KNOW. I UNDERSTAND.

00:18:56.954 --> 00:18:58.690
YOUR INTENTION IS HONORABLE,

00:18:58.756 --> 00:19:03.360
AND I HAVE AN IDEA THAT SHOULD
SATISFY YOU, SO DON'T FRET.

00:19:03.427 --> 00:19:05.530
WHEN YOU COME ACROSS
ALICE THE KNIGHT,

00:19:05.597 --> 00:19:08.299
YOU'LL BE ARMED WITH SOMETHING
THAT WON'T KILL HER.

00:19:08.365 --> 00:19:09.701
I MADE THEM SPECIAL.

00:19:11.302 --> 00:19:12.604
Kirito: DAGGERS?

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.771
Cardinal: OBVIOUSLY.

00:19:13.838 --> 00:19:16.574
WHOEVER THEY PIERCE
WILL BE INSTANTLY LINKED TO ME

00:19:16.641 --> 00:19:19.343
IN THIS LIBRARY
BY AN UNBREAKABLE CONNECTION.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.412
THE PERSON
WILL THEN BE SUSCEPTIBLE

00:19:21.478 --> 00:19:23.781
TO WHATEVER SACRED ART I CAST.

00:19:23.848 --> 00:19:27.985
TAKE THEM. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PIERCE HER FLESH

00:19:28.052 --> 00:19:29.787
WITH JUST ONE
OF THOSE DAGGERS.

00:19:29.854 --> 00:19:32.790
IN THAT INSTANT,
I WILL USE MY SACRED ARTS

00:19:32.857 --> 00:19:34.458
TO PUT HER INTO A DEEP SLEEP.

00:19:34.526 --> 00:19:37.962
SHE WILL STAY THAT WAY UNTIL YOU
HAVE HER MEMORY FRAGMENT

00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:40.064
AND ARE READY
TO REMOVE THE SYNTHESIS.

00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:41.465
Eugeo: ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:43.968
IF I CAN'T MANAGE
TO TALK SENSE INTO HER,

00:19:44.035 --> 00:19:45.537
I WILL USE YOUR DAGGERS.

00:19:45.603 --> 00:19:50.041
Cardinal: ACTUALLY, ONE OF THOSE
IS INTENDED FOR ADMINISTRATOR.

00:19:50.107 --> 00:19:52.510
THE OTHER ONE
IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SPARE.

00:19:52.577 --> 00:19:55.780
EITHER WAY, WHO GETS STABBED
WITH WHICH IS UP TO YOU NOW.

00:19:55.847 --> 00:19:58.115
Kirito: DAMN, TALK ABOUT
PUTTIN' ON THE PRESSURE.

00:19:58.182 --> 00:20:00.518
‐ WAIT. WE STILL NEED GEAR.
‐ Cardinal: HMM?

00:20:00.585 --> 00:20:02.453
Kirito: YOU SAID
YOU'D HELP US GET STUFF

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.988
THAT'S EQUAL
TO WHAT THE KNIGHTS HAVE.

00:20:04.055 --> 00:20:06.558
Cardinal: YOU AND EUGEO HAVE
POWERFUL SWORDS OF YOUR OWN,

00:20:06.624 --> 00:20:07.825
DO YOU NOT?

00:20:07.892 --> 00:20:10.361
THOSE SHOULD BE MORE THAN EQUAL
TO WHAT ANY KNIGHT HAS.

00:20:10.427 --> 00:20:13.030
Eugeo: DOES THAT MEAN
WHAT I THINK IT DOES?

00:20:13.097 --> 00:20:14.766
CAN YOU GET OUR SWORDS BACK?

00:20:14.832 --> 00:20:17.001
Cardinal: OF COURSE.
THERE IS AN ARMORY

00:20:17.068 --> 00:20:18.836
ON THE THIRD FLOOR
OF THE CATHEDRAL.

00:20:18.903 --> 00:20:22.239
THAT IS MOST LIKELY
WHERE THEY ARE BEING KEPT.

00:20:22.306 --> 00:20:24.609
Kirito: BY THE WAY,
HOW FAR UP DO WE HAVE TO GO

00:20:24.676 --> 00:20:26.578
TO GET TO ADMINISTRATOR'S ROOM?

00:20:26.644 --> 00:20:28.813
Cardinal: EACH YEAR,
THE CENTRAL CATHEDRAL

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.648
GROWS TALLER THAN THE LAST,

00:20:30.715 --> 00:20:33.818
SO HER CHAMBER SHOULD BE
ON THE 100th FLOOR BY NOW.

00:20:33.885 --> 00:20:35.286
( Kirito groans )

00:20:35.352 --> 00:20:36.588
Cardinal: UNFORTUNATELY...

00:20:36.654 --> 00:20:38.956
THERE IS ONE MORE THING
YOU NEED TO DO.

00:20:39.023 --> 00:20:40.692
Kirito: AH. YOU DON'T SAY.

00:20:40.758 --> 00:20:42.660
Cardinal:
YOUR SWORDS ARE POWERFUL.

00:20:42.727 --> 00:20:44.061
THAT MUCH IS TRUE,

00:20:44.128 --> 00:20:47.298
BUT THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH TO BRING
DOWN THE INTEGRITY KNIGHTS.

00:20:47.364 --> 00:20:49.500
THEY KNOW A TECHNIQUE
WHICH ALLOWS THEM

00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:51.268
TO AMPLIFY
THEIR WEAPONS'S ABILITIES

00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:53.505
MANY TIMES
OVER WHAT IS NORMAL.

00:20:53.571 --> 00:20:57.274
Eugeo: RIGHT. I BELIEVE IT'S
CALLED PERFECT WEAPON CONTROL.

00:20:57.341 --> 00:20:59.276
Cardinal: ONCE THEY
ACTIVATE THE SPELL,

00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:01.278
DIVINE WEAPONS
TAKE ON THE PROPERTIES

00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:03.848
OF THE THING
THE WEAPON ONCE WAS.

00:21:03.915 --> 00:21:08.520
IN OTHER WORDS, PERFECT CONTROL
RELEASES THE WEAPON'S MEMORY.

00:21:08.586 --> 00:21:11.388
AS A RESULT,
IT CAN UNLEASH POTENT ATTACKS

00:21:11.455 --> 00:21:13.224
THAT ARE FAR BEYOND NORMAL.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.593
I WILL ARM YOU BOTH
WITH THAT POWER.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.429
CLOSE YOUR EYES,
