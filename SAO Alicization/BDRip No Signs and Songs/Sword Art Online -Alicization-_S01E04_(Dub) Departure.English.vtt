WAY BIGGER THAN RULID, RIGHT?

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.852
( Eugeo laughs )
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

00:21:41.918 --> 00:21:43.854
( thunder rumbling )

00:21:46.757 --> 00:21:48.692
IT LOOKS LIKE RAIN'S COMING.

00:21:48.759 --> 00:21:51.828
WE SHOULD HURRY
BEFORE WE GET CAUGHT IN IT.

00:21:54.497 --> 00:21:55.732
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:21:55.799 --> 00:21:56.633
Kirito: HUH? WHAT?

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.902
Eugeo: NEVER MIND. SHALL WE GO?

00:21:58.969 --> 00:22:00.036
( Kirito chuckles )

00:22:00.103 --> 00:22:01.037
YEAH.

00:22:04.107 --> 00:22:06.042
